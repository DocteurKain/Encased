The cab moves down. The pulsating buzz of the elevators, similar to fast breathing. Rare streaks of white light from the wall lamps flash in the dull glass before flying up and disappearing into the black shafts. The elevator ride seems awfully long, but ends unexpectedly. The cab stops with a shudder. The double doors diverge. Behind them is pitch black, but as soon as you take a step forward, a bright white radiance dazzles you.

<nr>The recent conversation about the robbery has been replaced with a tense silence. [n][n]The Oranges exchange furtive glances, trying to decide how much you heard.</nr>

## CD1325 ## 01 ##
<nr>A big guy with his sleeves rolled up to the elbows looks your new Orange uniform up and down. [n][n]After a moment's consideration, he extends his hand.</nr>[n][n]I'm Theodor and this is Cowboy.

## CD1359 ## 04 ##
<nr>The Orange reluctantly rises from his seat, as if he's hoisting an invisible hunk of pig iron.</nr> [n][n]Ah, fuck her! Tell that Swedish bitch I'm working today, and make sure she don’t forget it!

## CD135A ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange lets out a hoot.</nr> [n][n]Ah, Oya sent you.[n][n]<nr>Chuckling, he cups his hands to his chest, as if holding an invisible pair of breasts.</nr>

## CD1374 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Oranges exchange a knowing glance, then nod to each other. [n][n]Theodor claps you on the shoulder and hands you a bag. Something clinks inside it.</nr> [n][n]Take this, it's yours.

## CD1379 ## 02 ##
<nr>Leary shifts his weight from foot to foot, looking around. [n][n]A pair of tightly packed bags rests on the floor nearby, prudently placed in a shady corner – it seems the Oranges have cleaned out the warehouse, as planned.</nr>

## CD13B3 ## 01 ##
Ask about Leary from Orange Wing.

## CD13E0 ## 01 ##
<nr>Nastassya gives a meaningful grunt.</nr> [n][n]This place has its own atmosphere, you know. They're saying in the reactor section that someone is running around in the tunnels, and it's not me. There are always Oranges hanging around, and they have all sorts of hiding places.

## CD13EE ## 02 ##
<nr>The images on the screens change. [n][n]The cameras now show the areas around the shared elevator and the Orange elevator.</nr>

## CD15C4 ## 01 ##
<nr>He's wearing a Blue Wing uniform, his face is frozen in horror, and his hands are splattered with the contents of his ripped open stomach. Interesting.[n][n]Bending over the body, you see a barely noticeable orange light glowing in the stomach cavity.</nr>

<nr>One of the grilles tilts slightly upwards. Someone (an Orange, judging by the uniform) peeks out from the ventilation system, looks around quickly, and disappears again.</nr>
<nr>L'une des grilles s'incline légèrement vers le haut. Quelqu'un (un Orange, à en juger par son uniforme) jette un coup d'œil par le système de ventilation, regarde rapidement autour de lui, et disparaît à nouveau.</nr>
## CD1923 ## 01 ##
  

## CD1944 ## 05 ##
<nr>Dean extends his second finger.</nr>[n][n]Second, self-defense. The rules don't allow for Oranges to carry weapons, but you still should know how to use one. Talk to Ms Margarita Tkachenko about that. Then you’ll have to go to the Training Zone. Do your best not to kill the instructor, please.
<nr>Dean tend son deuxième doigt.</nr>[n][n]Deuxièmement, l'auto-défense. Le règlement ne permet pas aux Oranges de porter des armes, mais vous devez tout de même savoir vous en servir. Parlez-en à Mme Margarita Tkachenko. Ensuite, vous devrez vous rendre dans la zone d'entraînement. Faites de votre mieux pour ne pas tuer l'instructeur, s'il vous plaît.

Answer that you don't know the causes, but you heard from other Oranges about the consequences.
Répondez que vous ne connaissez pas les causes, mais que d'autres Oranges vous ont parlé des conséquences.
## CD1E37 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange glares in your direction and spits on the floor.</nr>
<nr>L'Orange lance un regard dans votre direction et crache par terre.</nr>
## CD1E39 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange ignores you.</nr>

## CD2475 ## 01 ##
<nr>You happen to get surprisingly good cards. The Oranges study your hand closely, but have to admit defeat. [n][n]Butch carefully gathers the cards and hands you the deck.</nr> [n][n]Here, take it. You deserve it. This deck brought me luck – up until today. Maybe you can make use of it.

## CD2477 ## 01 ##
<nr>Sleight of hand, careful control of your facial muscles, and keen observation skills don't let you down. The Oranges throw their cards down in annoyance. Butch frowns.</nr> [n][n]Well, there you go. You've got my respect, for sure. They're right when they say a true master doesn't need luck.

## CD2479 ## 02 ##
<nr>Butch spots your cardsharping. The Oranges' faces grow markedly bored, their shoulders droop in exaggerated relaxation, and their voices slow.</nr> [n][n]Listen here, rat. Let this be the first and last time you try this bunk. Now get out while you're still in one piece.

## CD2481 ## 03 ##
<nr>You see two Oranges.[n][n]One of them is sitting against the wall, looking gloomy, the other pacing back and forth with his hands behind his back.[n][n]Looks like they’re arguing about something.</nr>

## CD2527 ## 01 ##
<nr>She quickly raises her index finger, as if remembering something important.</nr>[n][n]I also heard that Orange Wing employees are eligible to participate in experiments helping with scientific development! And they get to work outdoors. Sounds nothing like a prison, does it? It's all right here in this pamphlet.[n][n]<nr>The Silver hands you a glossy leaflet.</nr>

## CD2687 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Black's expression is hard to read. It's a complicated mix of irony, contempt, indignation and possibly surprise.</nr>[n][n]Did you just come here to rat out your Orange buddies? Get out, and close the door behind you.

## CD2689 ## 05 ##
<nr>You don't even have time to reach for the trapdoor – the Orange hanging around in the showers frowns and grabs you by the shoulder.</nr> [n][n]Hey you! Whaddaya want?

## CD268C ## 04 ##
<nr>A shower room is visible through the grill. Clouds of steam hang in the air, shrouding two figures: a man and woman in Orange Wing uniforms. [n][n]They’re discussing something in hushed tones.</nr>

## CD26BC ## 01 ##
<nr>She looks at the thing in her hands and then at you, enjoying your reaction.</nr>[n][n]This here's called the Kraut. It's a pneumatic gun for staples and nails. It's not technically a weapon, but when has that ever bothered you Oranges?

## CD2806 ## 01 ##
<nr>A ringer sounds unexpectedly, unnerving amidst the silence. An orange light ominously flickers in time on the intercom. No one answers – behind the reception desk is nothing but empty chairs scattered in disarray.</nr>

## CD297B ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange looks at you blankly.</nr> [n][n]We don’t bother you, and you don’t bother us. Let's call it quits.

## CD297C ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange frowns at you.</nr> [n][n]Get outta here. Can’t you see that rats aren't welcome here?

## CD297D ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange waves his hand at you, annoyed.</nr>[n][n]What's been played has been played. Smart motherfucker lucked out.

## CD297E ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange gives you a friendly nod.</nr> [n][n]Don’t get sore. If you didn't get the cards you wanted, it's no big deal. Wait and see how the wind blows!

## CD297F ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange waves his hand at you, annoyed.</nr>[n][n]Boastin' about your luck again? Good going, okay.

## CD2980 ## 02 ##
<nr>According to the badge, this Orange’s name is Patrick Norman. He jerks his chin impassively.</nr>[n][n]Take it up with Butch. He makes the decisions around here.

## CD2982 ## 02 ##
<nr>According to the badge, this Orange’s name is Patrick Norman. He bares his teeth in a grim expression.</nr> [n][n]We ain’t happy to see you here, but I'm gonna let Butch decide.

## CD2986 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange smirks unkindly.</nr> [n][n]Lookin’ for trouble? Well, Butch can decide what to do with you.

## CD2989 ## 02 ##
<nr>Clearly, you've interrupted some kind of a game – three Oranges freeze, their arms outstretched, staring at you perplexedly.</nr>

## CD298F ## 02 ##
<nr>Your cards are unexpectedly good. The Oranges look at the cards suspiciously, but throw in the towel. [n][n]After arranging the cards back into a deck, one of them holds it out to you.</nr>[n][n]Here you go, you deserve it. This deck brought me luck until today. Maybe you can make use of it.

## CD2990 ## 02 ##
<nr>Whether your opponents were better players or you simply had a run of bad luck, you lost. One of the Oranges taps you on the shoulder.</nr> [n][n]Come on, don't get pissy. It was the luck of the draw. Good game.

## CD2991 ## 01 ##
<nr>Some sleight of hand, masterful control over your expression, and a quick eye give you the advantage. The Oranges drop their cards in disappointment. One of them is getting dark in the face.</nr> [n][n]Kudos to you. I guess it's true that a real master never loses his touch.

## CD2993 ## 02 ##
<nr>Butch spots your cardsharping. The Oranges' faces grow markedly bored, their shoulders droop in exaggerated relaxation, and their voices slow.</nr> [n][n]Listen here, rat. Let this be the first and last time you try this bunk. Now get out while you're still in one piece.

## CD2A8A ## 01 ##
Ask how he ended up assigned to the Orange Wing.

## CD2BCD ## 02 ##
<nr>The camera glides through dim caverns as the silhouettes of bizarre mechanisms emerge. Metal structures loom up from the dark, surrounded by earth moving machines and exhausted miners wearing orange jumpsuits.</nr>

## CD2BDB ## 02 ##
<nr>He looks down at the documents again.</nr>[n][n]As I’ve already told you, someone up the chain decided to entrust this task to an Orange. Should you succeed, you’ll become a hero in the official propaganda, and should you fail... hmm... you’ll become a martyr, I suppose.

## CD2BDC ## 02 ##
<nr>Martin falters, choosing his words carefully.</nr> [n][n]You have to understand, the terms of the Orange contract involve... a certain level of risk. Fatal risk.

## CD2BF0 ## 02 ##
<nr>He marks one of the pages with a pencil.</nr>[n][n]The Orange Wing. Well... Whatever else can be said about me, I’m a humanist. I would never reject a person simply because they made a mistake. If it was a mistake. Tell me, how did you end up in the ranks of the Oranges?

## CD2C0F ## 01 ##
<nr>Martin spins his pencil between his fingers.</nr>[n][n]You know, seeing the Dome as a prison is very common among Oranges, partly because of the discrimination we admittedly haven't yet eradicated. Partly because of the abundance of guards. But more importantly, in my opinion, it's because this is a two-way problem: you expect this place to be a prison, not a home.

## CD2C1A ## 02 ##
<nr>Kingsley points at the camera.</nr> [n][n]You're from Orange Wing. Your duties involve taking risks, and you'll more often face difficult, grunt work. I don't think this mission requires an Orange participant, but my superiors are forcing my hand – someone on the Committee suggested it would be a good idea to use your performance over the next few days as a positive example... If it were up to me, I wouldn’t send you. But alas. Consider your mission to be of a propagandistic nature.

## CD2C2A ## 02 ##
<nr>An unkempt Orange with matted hair and a five-day beard is meditatively scrubbing a bench with a soapy sponge.</nr>

## CD2C2D ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange crouches in a dark corner smoking a roll-up cigarette.</nr>

## CD2C2F ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange pulls a handkerchief-wrapped something out of his pocket.</nr> [n][n]This watch? Take it. It's the only one I got. I didn't take any other.

## CD2C63 ## 03 ##
<nr>Heimlich shushes his partner, squinting at the camera right below the ceiling. [n][n]Levi continues in a whisper.</nr>[n][n]Have you heard of Joran Lindbergh from Orange Wing? He gets this stuff for people. It's not cheap, of course. And obviously not quite legal. Can we change the subject now?

## CD2CB4 ## 06 ##
<nr>Ida strokes her chin thoughtfully.</nr>[n][n]There's just one problem: you’re not from Black Wing and I can't entrust you with classified information. So act like a fucking Pinkerton – take a walk in the residential area, find a couple of loose-tongued Oranges, and see what you can find out.

## CD2CC1 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange looks up at you with calm but piercing glacier-blue eyes.</nr> [n][n]Good. I'll find the stolen watch for you. Is that all?

## CD2CD1 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange studies you for a few moments. Seeing you're unarmed, he returns the knife to its hiding place.</nr> [n][n]Never do that again. Why are you here?

## CD2CDF ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange stretches his whole body until his joints pop.</nr> [n][n]You're here not to talk about Buddhism. Why are you here?

## CD2CE0 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange nods slowly.</nr> [n][n]Good. Find Patricia in the laundry. She'll give you all the details. And try not to repeat your predecessor's mistake.

## CD2CFD ## 02 ##
<nr>The administrator looks pointedly towards the Orange residential area.</nr> [n][n]I think it's the cleaning staff, start with them. I'm a tiny and fragile girl, but you can intimidate them easily. Here’s another option: check the surveillance room, if they'll let you in, of course. Reznor's a bitch, so better ask Indra – he's a nice guy.

## CD2D7B ## 02 ##
<nr>You don't have to wait long at the checkpoint. A female Orange Wing employee appears from the showers, humming and carrying a basket of clean laundry.</nr>

## CD2D9E ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange gently pushes you a step back.</nr> [n][n]No, you can’t.

## CD2DA8 ## 02 ##
Give the Orange a shove.

## CD2DAD ## 03 ##
<nr>The grill turns out to be quite flimsy: it tears with a piercing screech as soon as you put your weight on it. Losing your balance, you fall down right at the feet of the Oranges.</nr>

## CD2DBB ## 02 ##
<nr>The Oranges discuss the details of the escape for some time, before they turn off the water and leave.</nr>

## CD2DF2 ## 02 ##
<nr>The soldier nods seriously.</nr>[n][n]Yes, there is news. I mean, we conducted a thorough investigation and found the thief. It's Gabriel Garcia from Orange Wing. He's already in custody. And the watch– Here is the watch.[n][n]<nr>Indra hands you a gold plated pocket watch.</nr>

## CD2E15 ## 02 ##
<nr>The conversation that resumed when you left immediately falls silent on your return. [n][n]The Oranges exchange grim looks.</nr>

## CD2F40 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Silver leans towards you.</nr> [n][n]Reznor is a drug addict. Everyone seems to know it, except Major and Kingsley. Some are saying that Courtney helps the Oranges.

## CD2F8E ## 04 ##
<nr>GABRIEL GARCIA[n][n]Orange Wing. Handyman. Breaking and entering, theft.[n][n]Restrictive measures: 4 weeks in punishment cell, no access to the residential area, enhanced supervision.</nr>

## CD2F8F ## 04 ##
<nr>HARRY ROCKWELL[n][n]Orange Wing. Loader. Damage to company property, unauthorized access to vending machines and public terminals. Habitual offender. [n][n]Restrictive measures: Disciplinary action, punishment cell (including time served). Not allowed to use terminals and vending machines.</nr>

## CD2F91 ## 05 ##
<nr>ENRIQUE ETERNO[n][n]Orange Wing. Junior Technician. Fraud, deception, confidence tricks.[n][n]Restrictive measures: Compulsory community service on the Laboratories Level. Security supervision.</nr>

## CD2FC4 ## 01 ##
Distract him by discussing the Oranges who'd been plotting an escape.

## CD2FCD ## 02 ##
Tell him you saw a couple of suspicious Oranges planning an escape.

## CD2FCE ## 01 ##
<nr>He leans forward to give your orange uniform a suspicious squint.</nr> [n][n]I'll be watching you, employee.

## CD2FCF ## 02 ##
<nr>Falco's expression grows quite serious.</nr> [n][n]I share your concerns, employee. Every Orange is suspicious, and no doubt planning an escape.

## CD2FD4 ## 02 ##
<nr>Lowering his voice and looking around, he says,</nr> [n][n]A smart person explained to me that one in twelve Oranges has never in fact been in prison. They said these people are agents who manipulate the actual criminals to seize power.

## CD2FF7 ## 02 ##
Say that you already retrieved the reagents and give them to the Orange.

## CD3000 ## 02 ##
<nr>Suleyman shrugs slowly and wearily, as if an anvil were perched on his shoulders.</nr> [n][n]Yes, they took your Orange away, but he didn't have the watch on him.

## CD3001 ## 01 ##
Tell him about the Oranges' drug trafficking scheme.

## CD3017 ## 01 ##
<nr>She puts her hands behind her head and stands near the metal detector.</nr> [n][n]Okay, boss. Patricia Lorde, Orange Wing, ready for inspection... Touch my boobs and you're dead.

## CD30AF ## 07 ##
<nr>From: Duncan O’Mallone[n]To: <...></nr>[n][n]Yo, bro! [n][n]That's how Oranges talk, right? I dig their slang. But that's unimportant. Check it out: I got my hands on the rarest issue of Captain Hyena! The very one, #13a, December 1970![n]I hereby extend an invitation for you to solemnly read it aloud.[n][n]P.S. I’ve got everything ready for the reading. Yeah, you got that right.

<nr>Pak gestures as if pointing at something.</nr> [n][n]Heard some skeezy gadfly on the level today boasting about his new watch. He's Orange, so he must've filched it. What was his name again? Right, Garcia!

## CD32B2 ## 02 ##
<nr>Here are two Oranges.[n][n]One of them is sitting against the wall with a hangdog look on his face. The other paces back and forth, hands clasped behind his back.</nr>

## CD32B6 ## 03 ##
Tell them you found a dead Orange and killed some frenzied lunatic.

## CD32BC ## 02 ##
Tell them about the Orange's body.

## CD333C ## 02 ##
Ask him what he knows about the Oranges’ escape.

## CD333E ## 02 ##
Ask him what he knows about the Oranges’ escape plans.

## CD3342 ## 01 ##
<nr>Suleyman wipes his forehead with the back of his hand.</nr> [n][n]What the– Sure he suggested it, he’s an Orange after all. What else do you expect? Listen. No evidence means no crime, understand?

## CD334C ## 02 ##
Ask him if he knows anything about the Oranges’ escape.

## CD3350 ## 02 ##
<nr>Damir frowns helplessly.</nr>[n][n]Moscardo... What, I'm sitting next to Oranges so I’m supposed to know everything about them? You should go to the informant, Adamidis. He mops floors in the labs.

## CD3351 ## 02 ##
Ask him what he knows about the conspiracy and the Oranges’ possible runaway.

## CD3352 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Silver smiles.</nr> [n][n]Oranges are great runners, especially when people are shooting at them. Any other questions?

## CD3353 ## 02 ##
Ask him if he knows anything about the conspiracy and the Oranges’ possible escape.

## CD3358 ## 02 ##
<nr>You eye him head to toe. [n][n]He has a narrow face and thick glasses. His hair, mustache, and beard are all carefully groomed and, unusually, his orange overalls fit perfectly. Even his hands look bizarrely kempt. [n][n]He’s either a metrosexual or a psychopath for neatness.</nr>

## CD3359 ## 01 ##
<nr>The mop sloppily kisses your foot again.</nr>[n][n]What? [n][n]<nr>The Orange's gaze is distinctly unfriendly, even defiant.</nr>

## CD3364 ## 02 ##
Say that if you snitch on him to the Oranges, they’re going to believe you over him.

## CD3366 ## 02 ##
<nr>Once he’s sure there's no one around to overhear, he walks up to you.</nr>[n][n]I’ll be a little bit more specific: there’s a shower room in the Orange residential area. They go in there and run the water while they discuss vital issues. If you ask me, that would include topics like escape. That’s all I can tell you.

## CD3368 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange goes pale with rage. The mop handle squeaks in his two-fisted grip.</nr> [n][n]Why you... you bastard!

## CD336D ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange takes a couple of steps back.</nr> [n][n]That’s all. Don’t walk here.

## CD3371 ## 01 ##
<nr>You chop the Orange in the neck with the blade of your hand, and he drops to his knees. [n][n]Abner starts to get up, but immediately falls flat on his back. He seems a little dizzy.</nr>

## CD3373 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange screams in pain and the shiv drops from his numb fingers.</nr>

## CD3377 ## 01 ##
<nr>Your calm tone has an almost magical effect on the Orange. [n][n]He relaxes his grip on the mop and nods several times.</nr> [n][n]That makes sense. Okay, let’s just talk it through.

## CD3411 ## 01 ##
  

## CD341B ## 01 ##
  

## CD3480 ## 02 ##
  

## CD34F5 ## 01 ##
Point out that you’re wearing a Orange Wing uniform.

## CD35E5 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Black finishes her coffee and crushes the cup in her hand.</nr>[n][n]Here’s what’s happening. After the <LRIncident>Incident</lr> we've got freedom here out the wazoo. CRONUS is no more, old contracts are no longer valid. If you want to get out just renounce your citizenship, hand over the selectrone, and go wherever you want. Even if you're an Orange.

## CD35E6 ## 06 ##
<nr>She glances at her communicator again.</nr>[n][n]And, still no messages from that asshole... Er, what was I talking about again? Right, the Oranges’ contracts state that if they want citizenship, they must agree to participate in scientific programs. But the bastards have suddenly remembered they have rights, and now I get word these rats are huddling in a corner, whispering about an escape. Abandon Magellan, live as a bandit commune in some locked-down facility, and some other crap like that.

## CD35FF ## 05 ##
<nr>An Orange is scrubbing the floor under the tireless gaze of a Black standing next to him and barking out orders.</nr>

## CD3600 ## 06 ##
<nr>In response, the Orange mumbles gruffly into his long, grey beard without lifting his head.</nr> [n][n]I’m doing the best I can. You don’t like it, mop it yourself, or maybe you could train a monkey to do it in your spare time.

## CD360B ## 05 ##
<nr>Both the Black and the Orange turn to stare as though you were an alien from a distant galaxy.</nr>

## CD3612 ## 01 ##
<nr>Recognizing you, the Orange greets you with a thin smile.</nr> [n][n]You just keep on wandering and wandering. Something troubling you?

## CD3618 ## 02 ##
<nr>Judging from the warm kitchen odors filling the tunnel, you’re in the right place. [n][n]You can hear the distant chatter of the TV in the barracks through the ventilation grate. [n][n]You can’t get a good view of the kitchen. All you can see through the grate are doors, a table, and orange couches.</nr>

## CD3623 ## 02 ##
<nr>You see yellow shelves on the walls and hideous orange couches. You see a wet vac and several planters with herbs. It’s a kitchen like any other. [n][n]Directly below the vent is a refrigerator. You can’t see the fridge from this vantage, but you can hear it humming.</nr>

## CD362A ## 02 ##
<nr>Next to the metal detector, a typical Dome scene is playing out: an Orange is standing with his hands behind his head while a small, angry Asian man in a black uniform pats him down.</nr>

## CD362F ## 01 ##
Tell the Black that he’s exceeded his authority and needs to return the Orange’s property.

## CD3631 ## 01 ##
Convince your fellow Black to leave the Orange alone.

## CD3634 ## 01 ##
<nr>You explain to Nakayama that treating people humanely (even Oranges) is more effective than intimidation and cruelty. Besides, the man he’s searching doesn’t exactly look like a hardened criminal.</nr>

## CD3637 ## 01 ##
<nr>You search the Orange’s pockets, but end up empty-handed.</nr>

## CD3639 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange sighs.</nr> [n][n]You took my beer and you took my chips. What’s the deal, Yato? I was sweeping the vehicle entrance. What could I possibly have stolen from there other than sand?

## CD363D ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange walks away, smiling good naturedly.</nr>

## CD363F ## 01 ##
<nr>He turns back to the Orange.</nr>[n][n]What are you chortling about, Moraitis? Is this a joke to you? You think this is funny?!

## CD3641 ## 01 ##
<nr>He walks up to the Orange and gives him a gentle push.</nr> [n][n]Take your junk food and get lost!

## CD365A ## 03 ##
<nr>The terminal bleeps softly and a list of entries appears.</nr> [n][n]AKHMED NOVAK, BLUE WING. ACUTE RADIATION SICKNESS. [n][n]MARK FENNING, BLACK WING. ANOMALY SYNDROME. [n][n]FAM SO JOHN, SILVER WING. ANOMALY SYNDROME. [n][n]MAGDA MARICHKOVA, ORANGE WING. CHRONIC RADIATION SICKNESS.

## CD3663 ## 03 ##
<nr>The following text is displayed.</nr> [n][n]Magda Marichkova, Orange Wing. [n][n]Ms. Marichkova worked as a janitor at a relic storage facility for about six months. She reported to sickbay due to intense menstrual pain, increased bleeding, and vomiting. She was diagnosed with chronic radiation sickness. [n][n]Severity is average. Recommend symptomatic treatment and hospitalization at a 24-hour facility. Storekeeper McPherson has been notified a large-scale <LRRadiation>radiological</lr> inspection is forthcoming. The question of the practicality of a full regenerative course of treatment for Marichkova has been raised.

<nr>A tough looking man in an Orange Wing uniform is leaning on a library cart.</nr>

## CD3804 ## 02 ##
<nr>A bruiser in orange overalls sits on the floor beside a young woman from White Wing. His expression is excited, even beaming. His eyes are wide open and his lips moving, but barely a sound escapes them.</nr>

## CD3807 ## 02 ##
<nr>A lithe woman dressed like a laboratory assistant is sitting cross-legged beside the beefy man from Orange Wing. She seems to be watching something with a skeptical smirk and commenting in a quiet voice.</nr>

## CD3827 ## 01 ##
<nr>Your head still aches severely from the rifle-butt blow, and you're only able to recall recent events with difficulty.[n][n]It seems you decided to go for a drive in someone’s car but lost control... They’ll probably produce some trumped up property damage charge at the trial and, if you’re unlucky, transfer you to Orange Wing.</nr>

## CD3883 ## 02 ##
  

## CD3884 ## 02 ##
  

## CD3AE8 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange isn’t being too careful with the device – the machine is wobbling from side to side, squealing and grinding. A light bar with the black silhouette of a dancing stripper flashes several times, then finally goes out.</nr>

## CD3AEC ## 01 ##
<nr>The thief whirls around, but seeing your orange uniform calms down immediately.</nr> [n][n]Hey. Don’t make yourself too conspicuous around here. The guards don’t like it.

## CD3B13 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange who broke the vending machine is sitting on the couch, making a paper boat out of a Laws and Regulations of the <LRFactionsNewCommittee>New Committee</lr> leaflet. He looks bored.</nr>

## CD3B18 ## 02 ##
<nr>Although the <LRIncident>Incident</lr> wreaked havoc under the Dome, order was maintained at the cost of tightening the laws and carefully monitoring their implementation. A lot of new responsibilities fell on the shoulders of Black Wing employees: preventing drug trafficking, keeping track of clearance regime violators, and guarding caravans against <LRFactionsFops>Fop</lr> attacks.[n][n]But some things remain unchanged. As before the disaster, the Oranges are still breaking vending machines...</nr>

## CD3B19 ## 02 ##
<nr>Silver Wing job descriptions changed very little after the <LRIncinedt>Incident</lr>, but their authority (as well as responsibility) increased. Rules require administrators to oversee implementation of <LRFactionsNewCommittee>New Committee</lr> laws in the field, monitor staff performance, and generally stay on their toes when it comes to Oranges.[n][n]Especially when it comes to Oranges.</nr>

## CD3B1A ## 02 ##
<nr>Guidelines written before the <LRIncident>Incident </lr> instructed White Wing employees to refrain from any contact with Oranges, except when required by official business.[n][n]Now that CRONUS has sunk into oblivion and the <LRFactionsNewCommittee>New Committee</lr> has replaced it, these rules are as relevant as ever. The brutal experiments conducted by White Wing have not increased their popularity among Orange employees.</nr>[n]

## CD3B1B ## 03 ##
<nr>As an Orange Wing employee, you are well aware that your colleagues were never really disciplined even before the <LRIncident>Incident</lr>. But it seems that since the collapse of CRONUS, crime has taken on a completely different scale and nature. This Orange is not surprised by the lone security guard in the lobby, nor by CCTV cameras hanging from the ceiling.</nr>[n]

## CD3B2D ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange looks around.</nr> [n][n]Go see Joran on the residential level, in the Orange section. He’s respected around here, gets shit done. Maybe he’s got somethin’ for you.

## CD3B30 ## 01 ##
<nr>Indra nods.</nr> [n][n]We found the thief. It’s Gabriel Garcia from the Orange Wing, definitely. Though we didn’t find the watch on him...

## CD3B44 ## 02 ##
<nr>REGISTRATION ENTRY ON 1976-09-01 [n][n]Butch Castiglione, Patrick Norman, Ivan Kuzemchenko, Orange Wing. Assigned to Magellan Station as laborers.</nr>

## CD3B4C ## 01 ##
<nr>You plug in the selectrone. The panel glows a cautionary orange.</nr>

## CD3BB7 ## 01 ##
<nr>You don’t have to wait long – a few minutes later, a thin old man in a white lab coat appears in the warehouse, accompanied by two gloomy looking Oranges and a technician.</nr>

## CD3BB9 ## 01 ##
<nr>The two sullen Oranges load the dead man onto a gurney and roll him away.[n][n]The doctor and technician exchange a couple of words and also walk away.[n][n]Only the wilted Keppler remains, staring down at the ruined armor on the floor.</nr>

## CD3BBA ## 01 ##
<nr>The Blue deals with the armor’s locks easily. After evaluating the victim’s status, the doctor injects a few CCs of painkiller into him and steps aside to let the Oranges through.[n][n]The silent attendants load Holiday onto a gurney and roll him away.</nr>

## CD3C37 ## 02 ##
<nr>A storm of emotions rages across the Orange’s face. [n][n]It takes her quite a while to find the words she needs.</nr>

## CD3C3A ## 01 ##
Ask if she’s heard anything about the Oranges’ escape plans.

## CD3C3E ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange shrugs.</nr> [n][n]No idea. I don’t listen to gossip, I've got too much to do. I water the plants, stuff like that.

## CD3C47 ## 01 ##
Ask him if he knows anything about the Oranges’ escape plans.

## CD3C51 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange taps the cover with a crooked finger.</nr>[n][n]There's one bloke from the ministry says that the others in the ministry are idiots. And then the other bloke says the first one is the real idiot. The third one says they're both knuckleheads. He’s the one who wrote the book.

## CD3CAA ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange gently lifts the rodent out of its makeshift enclosure.</nr>[n][n]I caught Plunger in the shithouse. It took me twenty minutes to hunt him down. I just knew he was the future champion back then. Bet on my boy here and you won’t regret it.

## CD3CBE ## 02 ##
<nr>This is easier said than done. The Orange is also blocking your path.</nr>

## CD3CC1 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange chuckles slyly.</nr>[n][n]The less you know, the better you’ll sleep. So you gonna place a bet? Don’t miss your chance.

## CD3D12 ## 01 ##
Give the Oranges your best threatening look.

## CD3D1B ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange puts the knife away.</nr> [n][n]Fuck, man, I thought we had a deal – no hidey-holes around the showers.

## CD3D1D ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange puts the knife away and makes a conciliatory gesture.</nr> [n][n]Naw, man, no questions. We good.

## CD3D20 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Oranges walk away, leaving you sitting in a puddle on the floor.</nr>

## CD3DF1 ## 01 ##
<nr>You arrive at the ambush point just in time for the thrilling conclusion: Ida Grace has her gun trained on two armed Oranges.</nr>

## CD3DF2 ## 03 ##
<nr>A guy in an orange jumpsuit is threatening the Black with a big, rusty revolver.</nr>[n][n]Put down the rifle! We’re two against one; you haven't got a chance. I said put that rifle down, bitch!

## CD3DF4 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange cocks his gun, teeth bared.</nr>[n][n]Hey, hey, hey! Leave my Momma out of it!

## CD3DF7 ## 01 ##
Talk to the Orange man.

## CD3DF8 ## 01 ##
Talk to the Orange woman.

## CD3DFB ## 01 ##
<nr>You recognize this Orange – it's Matthew Hauser, the guy who delivers books.[n][n]His angry squint suggests that he recognizes you, too.</nr>

## CD3DFD ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange peers suspiciously at you. His revolver is still aimed at Grace.</nr>[n][n]Whadda you want from me? You’d better stay out of it.

## CD3E02 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange woman is hanging both on your words, and Hauser’s shoulder.</nr>[n][n]Let’s put down the guns, Matt. I’m scared. We’ll get in trouble, Matt.

## CD3E07 ## 01 ##
<nr>You swiftly seize the Orange’s hand, jerking the gun up and twisting Hauser’s wrist at the same time.</nr>

## CD3E0E ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange narrows one eye with a snort, aiming at Ida.</nr>[n][n]So I wonder...

## CD3E10 ## 01 ##
<nr>You close awkwardly on Hauser, trying to seize his gun.[n][n]The Orange roars and grabs you by the neck.</nr>

## CD3E11 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange Dahlia Fleischner looks exactly the same as when last you saw her. Only the watering can is missing.</nr>

## CD3E17 ## 01 ##
Address the Orange woman.

## CD3E1C ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange takes her by the hand, his teeth set.</nr>[n][n]Dahlia, are you really gonna listen to them? They’re just tryin’ to take us down with smooth talk.

## CD3E20 ## 01 ##
<nr>You speak convincingly as Dahlia becomes more and more pale.[n][n]She staggers, drops her gun, and clasps the Orange man by the shoulder.</nr>

## CD3E21 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange looks at you, shocked, and lets her weapon fall to the ground.</nr>[n][n]Matt... No, Matthew![n][n]<nr>She pulls at the Orange man’s sleeve.</nr>

## CD3E26 ## 01 ##
<nr>You try to force down the barrel of the Orange woman's gun while she clutches it in a death grip.</nr>

## CD3E2F ## 01 ##
Say that you'll try to convince the Oranges to surrender their weapons.

## CD3E31 ## 01 ##
Convince Grace to let the Oranges go.

## CD3E38 ## 01 ##
<nr>Grace takes a couple of steps back, still aiming at the Oranges.</nr>[n][n]Did you hear that, you two? Scram!

## CD3E39 ## 01 ##
<nr>Without lowering their weapons, Ida and the runaways go their separate ways. The Oranges disappear into the dark of the rock maze, while Grace spits on the ground and leaves in the direction of the base.</nr> 

## CD3E4B ## 01 ##
<nr>Hands raised, the Oranges head off toward the base, escorted by the Black Wing officer.</nr>

## CD3ECD ## 01 ##
<nr>An orange crawler tractor truck is waiting at Gate 3. The vehicle's number has been scrubbed off by the desert wind and sand.[n][n]This must be the transport Kingsley spoke of.</nr>

## CD3EF5 ## CD01D9 ##
  

## CD3F7E ## 02 ##
<nr>The soldier dries the floor with his rag and draws the level's layout with his finger.</nr>[n][n]They say you Oranges make all your stashes in the ventilation system. Is that true? I guess it doesn’t matter. Look here, you can get into the ventilation, go through the tunnel, and watch what’s going on in the kitchen. Just sit and wait until the thief appears. Easy, right?

## CD3F7F ## 02 ##
<nr>The soldier dries the floor with his rag and draws the level's layout with his finger.</nr>[n][n]You know Oranges use the ventilation system all the time, right? So I decided to hide myself there and wait until the thief appears.

## CD3FCB ## 02 ##
<nr>The administrator starts nervously at your appearance and retreats a couple of steps, her eyes glues to your Orange jumpsuit.</nr>[n][n]You... you want something?

## CD3FCF ## 02 ##
<nr>Oya relaxes a bit.</nr>[n][n]Excuse me. I do not have the warmest relations with the Oranges.

## CD3FD0 ## 03 ##
<nr>She glances down at your Orange uniform again, but this time with a sort of hope.</nr>[n][n]But will you help me?.. Two Oranges are skipping work today. Maybe they will listen to you? Will you convince them for me?

## CD3FD2 ## 02 ##
Wait... I want to say that you are the very nicest Orange I know.[n][n]<nr>Oya looks embarrassed.</nr>

## CD4001 ## 02 ##
<nr>The shape resembles a human being, but only vaguely. The body is covered in filth and writhing while standing on the spot.[n][n]Orange lights dance in his irises and the white eyes cast an eerie glow on a face grey with dirt.</nr>

## CD400B ## 02 ##
<nr>But the scariest thing about this person is the eyes. Glowing white rings the irises, which flash bright orange.</nr>

## CD4092 ## 01 ##
<nr>...and set foot in a puddle of blood.[n][n]The floor tiles are stained with it. The Orange is on all fours, his abdomen ripped open, smearing blood all over the floor with his own intestines.</nr>

## CD40B6 ## 01 ##
Take a cautious look at the Orange.

## CD41BC ## 01 ##
You aren't like other Oranges.

## CD41BF ## 01 ##
Don't forget to register at the reception desk. All Oranges must remain under control.

## CD41C4 ## 01 ##
*To one side* I don't think it's a good idea to ask an Orange for help.

## CD41D9 ## 01 ##
<nr>You close your eyes and a picture appears in your head: a yellow desert with orange tractors crawling hither and yon. Something dark rises in the background. It clouds the sky, flashing greenish lightning. [n][n]The vision dissolves too quickly for you to guess what it is.</nr>

## CD41F4 ## 03 ##
<nr>This amber-orange ball, hovering above the scientific equipment connected to it, seems to be the reason for what happened in Nashville. You can feel the waves of anomalous radiation emanating from it with your whole body. A pleasant tingling rolls through your skin, and each wave fills your head for a mere moment with strange, rapidly fading images.[n][n]Without taking your eyes off the sphere, you move closer.</nr>

Whoever's first to get rid of all three bolts wins the game. The bid is 200 cabs and no pettifogging. You dig?

<nr>Butch thoughtfully stirs his pocket with his hand for a while.[n][n]Glancing at the other two Oranges, he nods confidently and calmly.</nr>

## CD4521 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange takes a step forward.</nr>[n][n]My move.

## CD4526 ## 01 ##
<nr>He doesn't think for long, but does it really carefully. Out there in the outside world, Butch must have been really good at this...</nr>[n][n]I think we have a couple of bolts here, not more.[n][n]<nr>Tells the Orange.</nr>

## CD4527 ## 01 ##
<nr>He doesn't think for long, but does it really carefully. Out there in the outside world, Butch must have been really good at this...</nr>[n][n]I think we have a single bolt here.[n][n]<nr>Tells the Orange.</nr>

<nr>He doesn't think for long, but does it really carefully. Out there in the outside world, Butch must have been really good at this...</nr>[n][n]I think we have no bolts here.[n][n]<nr>Tells the Orange.</nr>

## CD4530 ## 02 ##
<nr><LRBoltGameRules>Your move.</lr>[n][n]The Oranges look at you, waiting on your call.</nr>

## CD4542 ## 01 ##
<nr>You takes a small step forward and stop by the crate.</nr>[n][n]My turn. Two bolts out there![n][n]<nr>The Oranges nod and exchange looks.</nr>

## CD4544 ## 01 ##
<nr>You takes a small step forward and stop by the crate.</nr>[n][n]My turn. Three bolts out there![n][n]<nr>The Oranges nod and exchange looks.</nr>

## CD4545 ## 01 ##
<nr>You takes a small step forward and stop by the crate.</nr>[n][n]My turn. Four bolts out there![n][n]<nr>The Oranges nod and exchange looks.</nr>

## CD4549 ## 01 ##
<nr>You take a step forward and loudly call the number 7.[n][n]The Oranges exchange glances.</nr>

## CD454A ## 01 ##
<nr>You take a step forward and loudly call the number 8.[n][n]The Oranges exchange glances.</nr>

## CD454B ## 01 ##
<nr>You take a step forward and loudly call the number 9.[n][n]The Oranges exchange glances.</nr>

## CD4564 ## 01 ##
<nr>You open your fist.[n][n]The Oranges lean over a lone bolt lying in your palm.</nr>

## CD4565 ## 01 ##
<nr>You open your fist, showing the Oranges two bolts lying in your palm.</nr>[n]

## CD4577 ## 01 ##
<nr>Competent cheating is not only a matter of dexterity, but also of luck. Fortunately, there's nothing wrong with your luck – you're successfully running the plan right under the unsuspecting Oranges' noses.</nr>

## CD4583 ## 01 ##
<nr>You report to Butch that that was your last bolt. The Orange pretends to be surprised, but still gives you your winnings.[n][n]You place the small, but pleasantly dense pile of coins and banknotes in your pocket.</nr>

## CD4599 ## 01 ##
<nr>Your answer does not satisfy the Orange. Maintaing his grip on your arm, he quickly rummages through your pockets with his free hand.</nr>

## CD4624 ## 01 ##

## CD473F ## 01 ##
<nr>The stranger steps forward. He's wearing worn out orange overalls with patch pockets. His metal badge reads: Tim Ginzburg.</nr>

## CD4745 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange grins grimly in response, or rather attempts to grin. He doesn't seem able to control his facial muscles; his crookedly sneering lips are trembling.</nr>[n][n]Well, what does it look like? What do you think it looks like?!

## CD4746 ## 04 ##
<nr>Ginzburg goes quiet for a moment, struggling to contain his emotions. Then he continues:</nr>[n][n]It was already that bad. I told them we had to head back to Magellan, but Dekker made it clear she wasn't taking orders from some Orange convict.

## CD4747 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange keeps absent-mindedly flicking his flashlight on and off.</nr>[n][n]We never figured out what happened. They started throwing themselves at us on this level... Maria made a blunder, and they gobbled her up. After that, Dekker led us into a tiny room with these flimsy doors. Bob said he'd fetch help, but we lost contact with him after he left. Soon after that, Steele started acting crazy, and then I–

## CD4751 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange's expression begins to grow desperate, but in the next instant anger takes over.</nr>[n][n]Lies! I know the elevator is working– Wait! No, you destroyed it so we can't get out of here!

## CD4759 ## 02 ##
<nr>Her eyes are wide open. Thin but distinct white rings glow around irises dotted bright orange.</nr>

## CD4769 ## 02 ##
Observe that there are a lot of Oranges around, and that’s not safe.

## CD476A ## 03 ##
Given how quickly their numbers are dwindling, it won't be long before Oranges are replaced with contracted workers with no criminal past. Anyway, thank you for your opinion. It’s very important to us.[n][n]<nr>She strides swiftly away.</nr>

## CD4812 ## 01 ##
  

## CD4824 ## 06 ##
<nr>The Silver awkwardly rises to her feet.</nr>[n][n]I reckon you're from the rescue team. Well... as the expedition leader, I'll bring you up to date. The mission has failed. Our technician is dead, our guard disappeared, the Orange ran off, and the White is slowly going mad. That's my short report on the mission results. If you need more information, feel free to ask.

## CD49C3 ## 02 ##
<nr>You witness two Oranges, grunting and bathed in sweat, shifting a massive crate on a cart that wasn’t designed to carry such a load. The crate is poorly fastened as well, and according to its markings contains some kind of relic.</nr>

## CD49C5 ## 02 ##
<nr>You run up and lean into the crate shoulder first. It takes <Muscle>a lot of effort</lr>, but you manage to stop it falling and move it securely onto the cart.[n][n]The Oranges look at you as if Superman had just flown in. They shake your hand and correct their sloppy work by fastening the crate onto the cart with special straps. Then they roll the cargo away.</nr>

## CD49C7 ## 02 ##
<nr>The moment one of the Oranges stumble, the crate falls to the floor and cracks. Judging from the sound, so does the relic inside.[n][n]The accident is followed by an unbearably bright flash. You reflexively close your eyes, and the noise and tumult all at once cease.</nr>

## CD4A3A ## 01 ##
<nr>Ida gives you a brief, displeased look.</nr>[n][n]And you... Go, now. I've got plenty to do. I've got to file a report on these Orange corpses.

My informant reported that several Oranges were preparing an escape from the station. This could’ve cracked everything wide open, given the proper approach!

We were already planning the operation.[n][n]<nr>Ida paces the room, clutching the coffee cup in her fist.</nr>

<nr>The Orange turns and half-whispers to you.</nr>[n][n]Look, I don't need any trouble. You want to know about the escape plan, right? I'll tell you.

## CD4D70 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange falters, searching for the right words.</nr>[n][n]Just beat the shit out of him. Beat seven shades of shit out of him until he's wearing his ass for a hat! You get the idea, right? We're sick of this scumbag.

## CD4D75 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange takes a cautious look around, then bends close to your ear.</nr>[n][n]I know yer askin' everyone about the escape. Want me to tell you somethin’?[n][n]<nr>He whispers.</nr>

<nr>Casting haunted looks all around, the Orange slinks around the corner and disappears.</nr>

<nr>The technician slaps the door with one hand.</nr>[n][n]You'll have to wait until I'm done. Some Orange jammed up the lock with chewing gum, just for a laugh.

## CD58EF ## 01 ##
As an Orange, I'm sure you know what this is. But in case you don’t, I can teach you to pick locks. It's a useful skill, you'll see.[n][n]<nr>He looks at you expectantly.</nr>

<nr>The Orange catches the truncheon and squeezes it in his huge fist. The musclehead gives the Black a tranquil stare, though it is the tranquility of a grenade with the pin already pulled out.</nr>[n][n]Wanna join Davey at the sickbay? I can help you with that. 

## CD59A0 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange looks at you from under his eyebrows. His face’s calm, but he keeps clenching and unclenching his fist.</nr>[n][n]You shouldn't have. That's not the way to deal with them.

## CD59A2 ## 01 ##
<nr>Moving away, you see the policemen dragging the Orange through the back entrance to the back yard of the bar.</nr>

## CD59A5 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange chuckles. He is apparently surprised no less than they are.</nr>
<nr>L'Orange glousse. Il n'est apparemment pas moins surpris qu'eux.</nr>

Well, we've got the New Committee now, but with old weaknesses. They rebranded after the Incident, though everything only got worse in my opinion. That caste system of theirs... As a former Orange, I can say some of the Blacks and Silvers are a little bit too much in love with the new order. Bureaucracy, whistleblowing, bribes – in short, it's almost like some kind of post-apocalyptic dystopia here. Or shitopia, more like.[n][n]<nr>He gives a sad chuckle.</nr>

<nr>The Orange rests his gaze on your breasts. Bisley looks up at your face again and sneers.</nr>

You bastard![n][n]<nr>The guard shoves the Orange back and begins to pummel him with her fists. She doesn't stop until Bisley has fallen to the floor, shielding his bleeding head with his hands.</nr>

<nr>The moment he sees you, the Orange places himself between you and the box with the light bulbs.</nr>

## CD7519 ## 01 ##
<nr>A beefy Orange in a new jumpsuit is fiddling with the innards of a display board, watched closely by a supervisor. Frosted bulbs shine steadily through the mishmash of wires.</nr>

## CD7527 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange shakes his head in disbelief.</nr>[n][n]You... you should go be a circus performer.

## CD7529 ## 01 ##
<nr>You mumble and point at the bulb in your mouth. The Orange and the Black hesitantly approach.</nr>

## CD752C ## 02 ##
<nr>The guard pushes the Orange forward.</nr>[n][n]Thorsten, you’re the expert on light bulbs. Help the poor fellow.

## CD7559 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange strides determinedly down the hill, heading for the center of the field.[n][n]But then his trajectory changes from a straight line to a complicated path winding between the stones.</nr>

## CD7563 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange spits.</nr>[n][n]Some sick shit, that what's happened. You feel like the ground is spinning under your feet or something. Turn your head and it feels like your whole body went with it. No matter which direction you go, it's like it's always the wrong way.

## CD756C ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange covers his eyes with one hand and moves hesitantly towards the edge of the field.</nr>

## CD76CF ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange glumly waves your question away.</nr>[n][n]There's nothing to talk about. This place is creepy. I twisted my ankle in this fucking fog.

## CD7AF4 ## 01 ##
<nr>You meet a frail young woman in an orange uniform. She's looking around nervously as she walks. Your eyes meet.</nr>

## CD7AF7 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange walks decisively up to you. But when she sees your <LRBlackWing>black</lr> jumpsuit, she stops abruptly and begins to back away, still staring at you.</nr>

## CD7EE6 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange pats you on the arm with his ham hand.</nr>[n][n]Okay, peace out. If you're bored, stop by. I usually hang out here.

## CD7EFF ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange rubs his massive chin like a man polishing a boulder.</nr>[n][n]You seem pretty normal to me, so let's be honest: you won't make it as a <LRPartyAndLeadership>leader</lr>.

## CD7F9A ## 01 ##
<nr>He rolls up his sleeves and shows you the ring burns on both of his forearms.</nr>[n][n]I was originally an Orange. When it all began, I was being led to the SHU in handcuffs. The guard ran away with the keys. I was lucky there was a Blue nearby with a cutting torch.

## CD7F9B ## 04 ##
<nr>Another deep drag, and more smoke.</nr>[n][n]We raced here from Magellan, along with half the Orange block. Some never turned up, others tagged along with Papa Zemeckis, the ones who weren't into causing more mayhem. As for me, I like my freedom. Fighting, not so much.

## CD7FAD ## 02 ##
Yeah, I can tell. And not only the smile...[n][n]<nr>The Black squints and adjusts her bra beneath her uniform. The Orange tinkering with wires winks at you.</nr>

Ha! Are you from Junktown? Get this, they're having a mayoral election out that way. In Junktown! That's one heck of a joke right there! Do they think they're living in, like, a civil society?![n][n]<nr>The Orange laughs uproariously and turns away.</nr>

## CD8752 ## 02 ##
<nr>The patriotic Orange clenches his fists and juts out his chin.</nr>[n][n]The Council can go back where they came from! Am I right?

## CD8769 ## 03 ##
<nr>This man is very familiar to you. It's Tim Ginzburg, the Orange from the Magellan expedition. He’s wearing the Church’s scarlet robes now, and a small vinyl teleglasses bag hangs on his belt.</nr>

## CD8773 ## 05 ##
As soon as the third beacon is installed, you'll return to the Emulator and eliminate Maelstrom's radiation in the zones covered by the beacons. I need some additional equipment delivered to the third beacon, so would you please procure a heavy-duty truck from the Phalanx and get Nakamura to fund the expedition? Only the New Committee can afford these expenses. Phew, that’s all. I’m exhausted again.[n][n]<nr>Russo sits down and stretches out her legs, displaying bright orange socks.</nr>

## CD884D ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange is really scared, though more than he should be. After all, the Afflicted are not that uncommon. Something just doesn’t add up here.</nr>

## CD884E ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange is quite scared. After all, a group of Afflicted is a serious threat indeed. It’s a good thing you got warned in time.</nr>

<nr>This woman clearly did her time in the Orange Wing. Her dark skin is covered in blue tattoos, and her overalls, unzipped to the waist, are faded, but still recognizably orange. She frowns as you approach.</nr>

## CD8DF8 ## 05 ##
<nr>The lean Orange greets you with a quick, light handshake, then tips an imaginary hat in greeting.</nr>

## CD8DF9 ## 02 ##
<nr>The former Orange raises his hand in acknowledgement. But it seems to you that he always keeps anyone in his sight.</nr>[n][n]So, for now we're going to sit here like bugs under a glass, huh?

## CD8E82 ## 01 ##
<nr>You offer the glasses to the Orange.</nr>[n][n]Hey, cool. What ya got, cartoons yeah? I'm in. I always say Yes to every new thing. I really do, fucked my aunt once, you know![n][n]<nr>He laughs as he puts the device on.</nr>

## CD8E83 ## 01 ##
<nr>When the sermon begins, the cigarette drops from his mouth. The Orange begins feeling the empty space around him, as if checking the reality of what he's seeing.</nr>

<nr>A wan looking Orange gazes up at you wearily.</nr>

## CD8EAF ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange is immersed in grim thought.</nr>

## CD8EB7 ## 01 ##
Ask why people here treat the Oranges so badly.

## CD8EB8 ## 04 ##
<nr>He scoffs.</nr>[n][n]Because we're Orange. They've never looked at us as human beings, but now we're even lower than animals.

## CD8EB9 ## 02 ##
Interesting?[n][n]<nr>The Black scratches her head.</nr>[n][n]Well, I've heard the Orange have started draining freon from refrigerators. Can you imagine? They sell it to the Blues, and the Blues buy it because where else are you gonna get freon these days? It's enough to make a statue weep.

## CD8EBA ## 05 ##
How else would you treat them?[n][n]<nr>He shrugs in genuine bewilderment.</nr>[n][n]One's got to earn respect. The Oranges spend all their energy complaining instead of cleaning up their act, and you reap what you sow, right? He who would have the fruit must climb the tree. You can't hide a pig in a poke. A spoon is dear– No, that's not it. Anyway, why don't you mind your own business?

## CD8EBE ## 01 ##
New to Magellan? Be careful around the Oranges. Yesterday, my wallet was stolen in the dining room. Second time this year, by the way.

## CD8EC1 ## 01 ##
<nr>You walk up to the Orange and he says between gritted teeth:</nr>[n][n]Puta madre! Slapped with yet another fine, bastards! You can't even rip one without a fine anymore.

## CD92CE ## 01 ##
  

## CD92FA ## 01 ##
<nr>Aguirre is hiding behind his monitor again.</nr>[n][n]Maybe this is bureaucracy, but valuable tech like this can't simply be discarded. If selectrones end up in the hands of Orange Wing, it's one short step to the black market. Go to the administrative floor and talk to Ama Kamau to get the right papers.

Try living under the New Committee and you'll see! Oranges got an awful life there: fines, jail, fines for goin' to jail, and jail for not payin' your fines. Got locked up for some minor shit. When I got out, I'd already had enough of the bastards.[n][n]<nr>Ginzburg clenches his fists, his face turned tense and angry.</nr>

## CD9D73 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange gloomily sweeps the floor and says nothing.</nr>

## CD9D74 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange glances gingerly around, and after making sure no one else will hear, says in an undertone:</nr>[n][n]Hey! If you need an off-the-books selectrone, talk to Lindbergh. Don't know where he gets them, but he can sort you out. But you didn't hear it from me, right?

## CD9D78 ## 02 ##
If you see an Orange being mistreated, don't be surprised. That's the norm in these parts. I should probably skedaddle, but then they'd take my citizenship away. Gotta be more... creative.[n][n]<nr>He's already turning away as he says the last word, as if it wasn't meant for you to hear.</nr>

## CD9D79 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange is chewing thoughtfully on something, and doesn't pay you any mind.</nr>

Okay, here's the thing. Do you see the hall behind my back? I've just returned from there, from shipping. I've been moving some crates. They weren't sealed for transit yet, so I checked a few of them out, and looky looky – there are relics inside. I thought they were rubbish at first, but no, these are solid relics, category two. Hold on.[n][n]<nr>Darryl scoops a handful of orange dyed crumbled something out of his pack and puts it in his mouth.</nr>

## CDA592 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange stares grimly down at his boots.</nr>[n][n]Why'd ya do it, asshole? It's all over for me now! They'll send me to be a guinea pig in the mine, ya bastard.

## CDA5AE ## 02 ##
<nr>Kushner's superior expression rapidly fades. He forces a smirk.</nr>[n][n]You're gonna listen to a seasoned criminal, still wearing an Orange uniform even in the Phalanx? Her evidence is worth nothing.

<nr>The Orange sighs heavily and pulls a shiv from his pocket.</nr>[n][n]Okay, to hell with it. It's not such a high price for a life, eh? Though now that I'm unarmed, I should stay out of trouble anyway. Or I won't be rejoicing at my salvation for long.

## CDA7CC ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange gives a low whistle of respect.</nr>[n][n]Damn, look at that – you're a straight-up professional. Hey, I know it's awkward, this being the second time you helped me out. So, uh... thanks.

## CDA7D1 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange stands obediently still while you examine him. You find he has a gunshot wound in one leg and an abrasion on his head. He may have a concussion as well.</nr>

## CDA7D6 ## 04 ##
<nr>The Orange greets you with a nod. He looks a little better.</nr>[n][n]Damn, I was just standing here thinking what would've happened to me, if not for you. I get the shakes just thinkin' about it.

## CDA7D8 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange is visibly nervous – his eyes are darting all over the place, and he's compulsively putting his hands in and out of the pockets of his orange uniform.</nr>[n][n]Look, I'd be glad to, really, but I don't have anything on me. The Blacks took it all.

## CDA9C0 ## 01 ##
<nr>He stops laughing and refills his shotglass, growing grim.</nr>[n][n]I was in jail. Got here as an Orange, but changed that soon enough, managed to organize everything. I was noticed and promoted to the Blue Wing, took some of the more witty guys with me.

<nr>Oranges are in the minority here, so all this gets you is a rumble of disapproval.</nr>

## CDB249 ## 02 ##
<nr>Predictably, the Oranges take your words straight to heart. A barrage of empty bottles and crumpled cigarette packs fly at Spengler.</nr>

## CDB257 ## 02 ##
Don’t pitch us a line, Spengler![n][n]<nr>An Orange shouts. Snickers sound here and there in the crowd.</nr>

<nr>Spengler’s preternatural calm bears fruit – the audience is obviously gratified by the sheriff’s response. The Oranges like it the most, judging by their reaction.</nr>

<nr>This unexpectedly confident answer earns you the support of the Oranges and even a few Silvers.[n][n]A clerk raises his hand overhead in an appreciative thumbs-up.</nr>

## CDB26C ## 02 ##
<nr>You stay quiet, and the Oranges fall silent as well, with disappointment. They obviously expected you to be more imaginative in your replies.</nr>

## CDB272 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Blues and Oranges accept your answer with cheers, though the Silvers near the stage simply grimace. They obviously take a different view of workplace management.</nr>

## CDB288 ## 02 ##
<nr>You describe the bright prospects awaiting Junktown’s businessmen to Spengler.[n][n]The Blues very much approve of your explanation. It’s hard to tell what the Oranges are thinking, though they’re clapping as well.</nr>

## CDB290 ## 02 ##
<nr>You explain that the wall between the City and Junktown is there for a reason. It's unsafe here, and the solution is to make new laws as severe as possible.[n][n]Both Blacks and Silvers are satisfied with your answer. Displeased Oranges and Blues make a fuss.</nr>

## CDB291 ## 02 ##
<nr>You explain that the current legislation is unnecessarily strict and promise to introduce jury trials, reduce some crimes to administrative offenses and completely eliminate some others.[n][n]Your progressive attitude pleases the Whites and, of course, the Oranges. The Blacks and Silvers, however, are grumbling.</nr>

## CDB292 ## 02 ##
<nr>You remind everyone that Junktown was built on the labor of Blue Wing technicians and Orange laborers, and promise superb working conditions for these two groups.[n][n]The Blues and Oranges are thrilled by this, while the Whites and Silvers seem disenchanted with your priorities.</nr>

## CDB29B ## 02 ##
Conclude: you got into politics to defend human rights, freedom and the integrity of Oranges.

## CDB29C ## 02 ##
<nr>Wrapping up your speech, you explain that although you care about every voter, one group above all others needs someone to protect their interests – the Orange Wing laborers. You got into politics for their sake.[n][n]The Oranges raucously shout their praise for your conclusion.</nr>

## CDB2E3 ## 02 ##
Say that you wish to reduce social tensions by offering benefits to the Oranges.

## CDB2E4 ## 02 ##
<nr>Your response meets with general approval. Of course the Oranges like it most, but the representatives from the other Wings also find a certain wisdom in this approach.</nr>

## CDB2ED ## 02 ##
Say that with Spengler there will be no drama. Under him, life will be easier for everyone, even the Oranges.

## CDB2F4 ## 02 ##
<nr>You approach a noisy group of Oranges engaged in a drunken discussion.</nr>

## CDB2FA ## 02 ##
Explain that Kurt became sheriff to protect the Oranges from the authorities. As mayor, he'll do the same.

## CDB303 ## 02 ##
<nr>You offer them another bottle. The Oranges all clamor after it at the same time.[n][n]They're plainly already drunk.</nr>

## CDB308 ## 02 ##
<nr>The beaten Oranges who fought in the bar meet you with grim silence.[n][n]Apparently, word of the brawl at Bethany's has already spread all over Junktown.</nr>

## CDB318 ## 02 ##
The Oranges: Bethany Mortensen. That's it. Any more questions?[n][n]<nr>The Silver closes her portfolio and looks at you.</nr>

## CDB31E ## 02 ##
The Oranges: Kurt Spengler. That's all. Any questions?[n][n]<nr>The Silver closes her portfolio.</nr>

## CDB320 ## 02 ##
The Oranges: for you. That's all. Any more questions?[n][n]<nr>The Silver closes her portfolio.</nr>

## CDB331 ## 02 ##
Develop your idea: Junktown’s people are united in their lack of civil rights, so the first step should be granting those rights to everyone, starting with the Oranges.

## CDB378 ## 02 ##
<nr>She turns to the last page.</nr>[n][n]And finally, the Oranges. The Oranges chose Bethany.

## CDB37E ## 02 ##
<nr>She turns to the last page.</nr>[n][n]And finally the Oranges... Well of course, Spengler.

## CDB380 ## 02 ##
<nr>She turns to the last page.</nr>[n][n]And finally the Oranges... Well, well, they chose you.

<nr>The firecracker from the turret’s barrel grazes Clara. The Blue lets out a cry and hammers down on the accelerator.[n][n]With a roar, the truck flies into the parking lot. A couple of other orange tractor trucks are already parked there.</nr>

## CDB698 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange frowns.</nr>[n][n]Yeah, it's like I said on the radio. They led us like cattle to the slaughter, me and four other guys.

## CDB69A ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange grimaces in disgust.</nr>[n][n]So I was digging, my friends' four corpses lying nearby, and these bastards sat down to eat as if nothing had happened.

## CDB69B ## 02 ##
After that, they all lit up cigarettes. I asked if I could have one. I ain't a fool, I knew what came next, so it was sorta like a last wish. But these absolute fuckers said No, let that sink in.[n][n]<nr>The Orange spits on the ground.</nr>

## CDB69D ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange runs his hand over the back of his head and squints in pain.</nr>[n][n]And that's basically it. They kicked me on the head and I woke up in the dark. They threw that radio in the box with me, to mock me. Except it wasn't as broken as they thought. Sons of bitches.

<nr>And step on a bloody stain.[n][n]The floor tiles are covered with blood. The Orange, down on all fours, is smearing it with his own intestines fallen out of his ripped abdomen.</nr>

## CDB9B0 ## 02 ##
<nr>You tell a long joke, and the Blue's hand finally freezes in the air before your punchline. When, barely suppressing your laughter, you say the man just asked the genie for a half an orange instead of a head, you finally burst out laughing. A faint smile appears on the Blue's face for a second.</nr>

## CDB9CC ## 02 ##
<nr>On the floor before the TV, there is some big guy sprawling, in Orange uniform, bold and with tatoos. He's looking at the ripple on the monitor and smiling happily.</nr>

## CDBC1A ## 01 ##
<nr>Schmitz smooths down a seam with his finger.</nr>[n][n]The stairs in the security room lead to warehouse parking. You're looking for an orange tractor truck. The driver's name is Clara Morgan, she'll take you to the facility.

## CDBD1A ## 01 ##
  

## CDBDB2 ## 01 ##
<nr>The young woman laughs hysterically at your buffoonery.</nr>[n][n]Damn glad to finally meet you! I’m Louise Dekker-Schulz, leader of the expedition which is no more. The Orange ran away, the Blue died, we’ve got no news from our Black, and our White’s gone mad. Tell your superiors. Also tell them their rescue operation can kiss my fat, pasty white ass!

## CDBFA8 ## 02 ##
<nr>The bright orange terminal has a faint odour of new plastic and enamel. The splash screen for the stripped down version of CaerOS is playing – that's what's usually installed on library mainframes and info terminals.[n][n]Judging by the Department of Advanced Training sticker, you're standing in front of just such a terminal.[n][n]You switch to Main Menu.</nr>

## CDC073 ## 01 ##
  

## CDC140 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange raises his hand and points an invisible gun at you.</nr>

## CDC148 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange waxes thoughtful.</nr>[n][n]I thought about you once in a while. Wondered whether you managed to survive the <LRIncident>Incident</lr>.

## CDC181 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange gives a careless shrug.</nr>[n][n]The hell would I know? Probably some scum ratted on us. The Blacks came in and chased everyone away.

## CDC185 ## 01 ##
<nr>A skinny and unpleasant looking Orange is rummaging through a heap of spare parts. His worn jumpsuit is stained with gas and oil.</nr>

## CDC188 ## 01 ##
<nr>You see Justin Bradbury, one of the rat race enthusiasts.[n][n]The skinny, nervous Orange is rummaging through some spare parts. His eyes glisten strangely.</nr>

## CDC18D ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange scowls at you and returns to scrounging for parts.</nr>

## CDC300 ## 01 ##
<nr>She smothers the orange sparks on the asphalt with the toe of her shoe.</nr>[n][n]If I was dealing with CRONUS, they'd tell me what happened to Layton. But there's no Committee anymore. It's just a logo now. What am I telling you for? You already know that.

## CDC466 ## 01 ##
<nr>A plump Orange is playing a game on his CAERUS. He gazes up at you.</nr>[n][n]I remember you: we saw each other at the race. T'was a good one. Hell knows when the next one will be. Gallop likes to play it safe.

## CDC468 ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange keeps on enthusiastically clicking the CAERUS buttons. Every once in a while, he mumbles something to himself and chuckles. He doesn't even look at you.</nr>

## CDC469 ## 01 ##
A lean, unpleasant looking Orange with sharp cheekbones is rummaging through a heap of spare parts.</nr>

## CDC46B ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange keeps on rummaging.</nr>

## CDC46D ## 01 ##
<nr>The Orange beckons you closer with a crooked finger and slings a friendly arm around your neck.</nr>[n][n]We're thinking about organizing our own race, with larger bets and simpler rules. Neat, huh? You in or not? Nope? Well, suit yourself.

## CDC545 ## 02 ##
Ask what happened after you registered him in the Orange Wing.

## CDC549 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Silver opens his mouth to answer, and suddenly begins to laugh uncontrollably, almost hysterically.</nr>[n][n]Whoo... That guy... whatsisname? Maynard! Yes, Maynard. He gave me an Orange uniform, and when I started throwing my weight around, he called the guards and they roughed me up. And then they did it again, and said I had stolen my overalls from someone, and that's, like, a serious crime. They cuffed me up and shipped me off to Magellan.

## CDCD60 ## 01 ##
<nr>The TV displays an interview with an Orange.</nr>[n][n]So, like, the grub's okay: veggies, bread, mash, friggin' schnitzel! Wha? Naah! Ain't payin' for nothin' here, munchin' fo free. And they give us these antirad pills. Lemme say it short: Glory to Chairman Nakamura!

## CDCD61 ## 01 ##
<nr>No one takes him seriously. The soldiers laugh, the Oranges try to catch him and disassemble him for parts, the Blues call him an outdated model... Only a scientist in a white coat finds a Forefathers relic inside Doe. Then the little robot becomes the hero everyone loves.</nr>

## CDCD63 ## 01 ##
<nr>There's not even a cartoon on, just some children's educational program. A girl in a silver jacket sits surrounded by dolls dressed in orange uniforms. She counts out loud how many relics the Orange Wing workers have extracted, and by how many units this number is above average.</nr>

<nr>Frowning, the Orange throws an empty snack bag in your face.</nr>[n][n]You greedy bitch! Get outta here.

<nr>You see a man with a scarred, hairy face. He stares as you approach.</nr>[n][n]You need something?

## CDE3FB ## 02 ##
<nr>The scarred, laconic man greets you with a nod.</nr>[n][n]Well?

## CDE3FC ## 02 ##
Say you need help in the Arena.

## CDE3FD ## 02 ##
Tell him you no longer need his help.

## CDE3FE ## 02 ##
<nr>The man nods after a pause.</nr>[n][n]I’ll help. Been long since I've had a good practice.

## CDE3FF ## 02 ##
<nr>The man shrugs.</nr>[n][n]As you wish.

<nr>The nameless man shoots you an inquiring glance.</nr>[n][n]Why the delay?

<nr>He glances at your companions, then shakes his head.</nr>[n][n]No.

## CDE404 ## 02 ##
<nr>You see a young man mumbling something under his breath, head downcast. He looks sorrowfully up at you.</nr>[n][n]Oh, umm, hello... I... Can I help? I’m Larry, by the way.

## CDE405 ## 02 ##
<nr>Larry is rocking on his heels. He stops when you approach.</nr>[n][n]Ah, it’s you again. I mean, um, hello. Can I help you? Well, if I'm able.

## CDE406 ## 02 ##
Say you need help in the Arena.

## CDE407 ## 02 ##
Tell him you no longer need his help.

## CDE408 ## 03 ##
<nr>Larry thinks for a long while before answering.</nr>[n][n]Well... all right, I guess so. Everyone’s gotta die sooner or later. Let’s go then.

## CDE409 ## 02 ##
<nr>Larry exhales in relief.</nr>[n][n]I guess that means I’ll live a little longer.

## CDE40A ## 02 ##
<nr>Deep in thought, Larry starts.</nr>[n][n]Oh! Sorry, I’ve been thinking about... Well, never mind. What’s up?

## CDE40B ## 02 ##

<nr>Larry eyes your squad.</nr>[n][n]No, sorry. I, you know... There’s too many of you. I don't feel comfortable in crowds.

## CDE40E ## 02 ##
<nr>The man in the black uniform is standing at attention, quite motionless. The medals on his uniform appear to be handmade from all kinds of junk.</nr>[n][n]Sergeant Brian Price, Black Wing. At your service.

## CDE40F ## 02 ##
<nr>Brian stares at you.</nr>[n][n]Soldier, it drives me mad when someone just gawks at me. Either say what you want or go on your way.

## CDE410 ## 02 ##
Say you need help in the Arena.

## CDE411 ## 02 ##
Tell him you no longer need his help.

## CDE412 ## 02 ##
<nr>Price rapidly becomes animated.</nr>[n][n]Oh yes, my time has come at last! Very well, fresh meat, let’s test ourselves on the field of battle! Whose asses are we gonna kick?

## CDE413 ## 02 ##
<nr>Price’s lower lip trembles, but he dams up his feelings.</nr>[n][n]It was an honor to serve with you!

## CDE414 ## 02 ##
<nr>Price snaps to attention when you address him.</nr>[n][n]Do you need anything? I suggest we waste no time, and go find someone desperate for a sock in the jaw.

## CDE415 ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE416 ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE417 ## 02 ##
<nr>Price raps out every word, using none of his muscles outside of his jaw.</nr>[n][n]Negative! I’m good, but even I can't protect that many asses at one time!

## CDE418 ## 03 ##
<nr>This young woman’s white uniform is marked with small burns and scorch marks. She is clearly very excited.</nr>[n][n]Hey, hello! I’m Yong Shu and I ADORE explosions. Are you here to fight in the Arena?

## CDE419 ## 03 ##
<nr>Yong Shu smiles at you.</nr>[n][n]If you're asking about the broken terminal, I’ve got nothing to do with it.

## CDE41A ## 02 ##
Say you need her help in the Arena.

## CDE41B ## 02 ##
Tell her you no longer need her help.

## CDE41C ## 02 ##
<nr>Yong claps her hands, thrilled.</nr>[n][n]Excellent! I can finally test my inventions!

## CDE41D ## 02 ##
<nr>Yong pouts, dispirited.</nr>[n][n]Very well, then. I’m not offended, mind you. Not a bit. Nope.

## CDE41E ## 02 ##
<nr>Yong Shu is moving in time with the music, which must be playing in her head.</nr>[n][n]So, who are we going to blow up today? I’m kidding, of course. All right, I’m not. Really, when can we start?

## CDE41F ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE420 ## 02 ##

<nr>Yong looks over your squad with an uncertain expression.</nr>[n][n]No, sorry. I’d love to, but there are too many of you. Someone could accidentally get hurt.

<nr>A tightly built Black shifts from standing at attention to "at ease" and nods to you.</nr>[n][n]In my opinion it's good protection, not offense, that makes the best defense! The Arena is a tough place. You won’t fare well without proper armor.

## CDE429 ## 02 ##
Trade with him.

## CDE42A ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE42B ## 02 ##
<nr>The Black salutes you.</nr>[n][n]Good luck in the fight. And be careful not to let your armor get trashed.

## CDE42C ## 02 ##
<nr>You see a portly man deeply involved in chewing a piece of meat.</nr>[n][n]Hi! These fights are terribly exhausting; best fill your stomach before entering the Arena. There's no restaurant here of course, but the food is hot and tasty. And what else could one wish for, eh?

## CDE42D ## 02 ##
Trade with him.

## CDE42E ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE42F ## 02 ##
<nr>The trader’s still chewing his meat.</nr>[n][n]Good luck in the Arena. If you have to die, better to do it on a full stomach, eh? Haha!

## CDE430 ## 02 ##
<nr>You see a young woman in a White Wing uniform behind a counter full of medications and pills.</nr>[n][n]Scratch, fracture, cut, bleeding? No problem – I’ve got remedies for whatever ails you.

## CDE431 ## 03 ##
Trade with her.

## CDE432 ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE433 ## 02 ##
<nr>The White clasps her hands behind her back and nods.</nr>[n][n]Any time you get wounded, I’m here to help. For a price, of course.

## CDE434 ## 02 ##
<nr>You see a trader wearing glasses and blue overalls in front of you. His belt is full of various dangling tools.</nr>[n][n]Hello! If you’re going to the Arena, I advise to prepare yourself as best you can. My tools will be of great use to you. Have a look, pick something for yourself.

## CDE435 ## 03 ##
Trade with him.

## CDE436 ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE437 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Blue lights up a cigarette.</nr>[n][n]If you need anything else, get right back to me.

## CDE438 ## 02 ##
<nr>You see a trader with all kinds of weapons spread across the counter behind his back.</nr>[n][n]Hello. I’d buy something from me before going to the Arena, if I were you. Have a look, I'm sure you'll find something suitable.

## CDE439 ## 02 ##
Trade with him.

## CDE43A ## 02 ##
Leave.

## CDE43B ## 02 ##
<nr>The trader nods.</nr>[n][n]If you need anything else, I’ll be here.

## CDE4B8 ## 02 ##

I’ll be quick, just there and back again! Have a heart! I’ve already put plusses everywhere and the highest marks, I swear, only the signature left!

## CDE7BD ## 03 ##
<nr>When you approach the Orange again, he’s standing to attention, face impassive. You notice a plea for help in his eyes with a closer look, though.</nr>[n][n]The methods are undoubtedly both effective and humane. The Phalanx and the New Committee may be proud of such... such... crap, I forgot it again, boss! Let me go, please, I’ll learn it, I swear!

## CDE7E3 ## 01 ##

<nr>You must be witnessing a secret rite. The three Oranges freeze, fists stretched out in front of them, and stare at you in confusion.[n][n]Who are they? Cultists? Members of a clandestine fellowship? Under the Dome is turning out just like a cartoon!</nr>

## CE00010486 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange shakes your hand. His palm is hot and sweaty, and his hand is trembling.</nr>[n][n]I don't even want to think about what would've happened if not for you. Of course I'm sad about the guys, but there's nothing I can do about that. I'd love to find those Black jerks, though, just to see the look on their fat, monkey faces.

## CE00010487 ## 02 ##
<nr>The Orange shrugs in apology.</nr>[n][n]Come on, simmer down. I just haven't snapped out of it yet. It don't matter to me if you're Black or Silver, I couldn't care less. So yeah, thanks.

## CE00010488 ## 03 ##
<nr>The Orange sighs in relief.</nr>[n][n]I'm sorry. If I had anything at all, of course I'd give it to you. No price is too high for what you done for me.

<nr>The Silver lets out a heavy sigh.</nr>[n][n]It's good that you came to me for clarification. So, one more time: Go down the stairs to the warehouse. Get into the big orange car.

<nr>Slight confusion wrinkles Mother's serene face.</nr>[n][n]Two Oranges. One Black. Two Silvers. So many fates and opportunities, chances to walk different paths and gain nothing. Either you are with them, or you are against them.

<nr>The sheriff takes the microphone and turns to the crowd.</nr>[n][n]I've got only one question: how would those not doing business benefit in this case? There'll be more competition between the traders, while the least protected members of the community - the hired workers, mostly Oranges - will be in deep shit. They will be paid even worse. Is this what you want?

<nr>The gas station is bustling with life – a couple of Phalanx caravanners are arguing in a low voice, and a big, angry looking Black Winger is dragging a stubborn Orange behind him.

You went to junktown and spoke with Phalanx ambassador Don Spencer. He showed you where to look for the caravan carrying the Transcriptor – a relic needed to launch the Emulator.

## CE0001C0D9 ## 00 ##
Don Spencer, Phalanx ambassador, sent you a message about where to find the caravan carrying the Transcriptor – a relic needed to launch the Emulator.

## CE0001C0DA ## 00 ##
Using the map in your CAERUS, you arrived at the place where the caravan supposedly disappeared.

## CE0001C0DB ## 00 ##
You found the Fops who plundered the caravan and took the Transcriptor.

## CE0001C0DC ## 00 ##
You managed to get the Transcriptor back.

## CE0001C0DD ## 00 ##
After obtaining the Transcriptor, you delivered it to the Emulator.

## CE0001C0DE ## 00 ##
Maelstrom Church promised to provide special teleglasses needed for the Emulator to work. You met Reverend Santiago in Junktown. He promised to give you the device if you attend a free sermon.

## CE0001C0DF ## 00 ##
You managed to get the teleglasses for the Emulator.

## CE0001C0E0 ## 00 ##
You have brought the teleglasses to the Emulator.

## CE0001C0E1 ## 00 ##
For the Emulator systems to function correctly, you will need anomalous essence, which you can get in the Picnic neutral zone. Audrey Melville, the leader of the Picnic, is ready to give you the essence in exchange for money or a small favor – you will have to clear out the swamp from mutated cockroaches.

## CE0001C0E2 ## 00 ##
You have the anomalous essence.

## CE0001C0E3 ## 00 ##
You have brought the anomalous essence to the Emulator.

## CE0001C0E4 ## 00 ##
The Emulator won't launch without a new version of the drivers, and Karma Ishtwani, the ambassador of Carmine Heights, knows where to get them: you must go to the camp at Maelstrom border, meet with the research team, and copy the driver to a floppy disk.

## CE0001C0E5 ## 00 ##
Upon arriving at the camp that Karma told you about, you only found corpses. The scientists who wrote the driver for the Emulator fell victim to bandits.

## CE0001C0E6 ## 00 ##
Having scanned the dead scientists' handhelds, you entered the data into the system and obtained a working driver.

## CE0001C0E7 ## 00 ##
You have brought the driver to the Emulator office.

## CE0001C0E8 ## 00 ##
The Emulator will require a lot of power to function, and the power grid connecting the reactor and the Emulator systems has been damaged. You will have to go to Magellan station and solve the problem at the reactor floor.

## CE0001C0E9 ## 00 ##
After reconfiguring the reactor mainframe, you find that the problem persists. You will have to check the fuse boxes located one floor below.

## CE0001C0EA ## 00 ##
Traces of sabotage were found in one of the fuse boxes.

## CE0001C0EB ## 00 ##
You have replaced the blown fuses with working ones.

## CE0001C0EC ## 00 ##
After restarting the reactor mainframe, the power supply to the Emulator was restored.

## CE0001C0ED ## 00 ##
You returned to the Emulator and turned on the device's power.

## CE0001C0EE ## 00 ##
A couple of days after you finished preparing to launch the Emulator, you received a message. All systems are ready. You just have to connect to the Emulator and get in touch with Maelstrom.

## CE0001C0EF ## 00 ##
Your mind met Maelstrom again and you convinced it to retreat...

## CE0001C0F0 ## 00 ##
The communication session with Maelstrom ended in your favor. Thus, you won the battle, but not the war: Maelstrom has shrunk, and its radiation has weakened, but at the same time it got out of the Emulator's control.

## CE0001C0F1 ## 00 ##
Head of the New Committee Kimiko Nakamura has contacted you and invited you to the Council meeting which will be held in the City in the near future.

## CE0001C0F2 ## 00 ##
You attended a meeting of the Council. Now you have to return to the Emulator and find out what to do next.

## CE0001C0F3 ## 00 ##
After your return to the Emulator, the plan became somewhat clearer: in order to suppress Maelstrom's resistance, you will have to contact it again, having built a special communication system. To do this, you need to get three Maelstrom beacons in Carmine Heights and improve them with the help of Picnic neutral zone – they have schematics of the so-called anomaly protector, which will keep the beacons from the destructive radiation of Maelstrom. The beacons will have to be installed in Magellan's parking lot, on the Nashville observation deck and in the camp of the First Settlers. The coordinates of the camp have been lost, but the Fops know its location. To install the last beacon, you will need a special protective implant which is at the disposal of the Maelstrom Church.

## CE0001C0F4 ## 00 ##
After the preparatory work is completed, you will need to organize an expedition to the ruins of the Concord. It will be funded by the New Committee, and special heavy vehicles will be provided by Phalanx or the White Lines caravan company.

## CE0001C0F5 ## 00 ##
Upon arriving in Carmine Heights, you spoke to the Raysner spouses who run the settlement. They promised to give beacons, but on the condition that you help solve their problems.

## CE0001C0F6 ## 00 ##
One of the main problems for the family was the preparation for the head of Carmine Heights election. You posted the Raysners' campaign posters on the notice boards around the settlement.

## CE0001C0F7 ## 00 ##
Johan Raysner has high hopes for the isosuit – a device using which humanity will presumably be able to leave the Dome. You had a hard time tinkering the suit, but the project got off the ground.

## CE0001C0F8 ## 00 ##
Johan Raysner has high hopes for the isosuit – a device using which humanity will presumably be able to leave the Dome. You tried to help, but it seems that you only made things worse. 

## CE0001C0F9 ## 00 ##
The water supply system is one of the main problems for the inhabitants of the settlement. You have configured the distiller so that there is enough water in the canteen, hydroponic farm, and laboratory.

## CE0001C0FA ## 00 ##
The water supply system is one of the main problems for the inhabitants of the settlement. You tried to configure the distiller but failed to achieve the desired result.

## CE0001C0FB ## 00 ##
You've got the Maelstrom beacons.

## CE0001C0FC ## 00 ##
To get the anomaly protectors, you went to the Picnic Neutral Zone. Audrey Melville promised you a blueprint for the device in exchange for help: you must find the family who went to join the Picnic and disappeared...

## CE0001C0FD ## 00 ##
You have found the missing family's camp.

## CE0001C0FE ## 00 ##
Upon returning to Audrey, you told her that you found three corpses in the camp. Apparently, the family did not survive. Audrey was upset, but said she would honor the deal.

## CE0001C0FF ## 00 ##
After wandering around the camp, you found three survivors in a deep well.

## CE0001C100 ## 00 ##
By lowering a rope into the well, you saved three members of the Janssen family.

## CE0001C101 ## 00 ##
After speaking with the Janssens, you advised them to join the Picnic.

## CE0001C102 ## 00 ##
After speaking with the Janssens, you advised them to join the Maelstrom Church.

## CE0001C103 ## 00 ##
Upon returning to Audrey, you told her that you had sent the Janssens to the Maelstrom Church. Audrey was furious, but said she would still honor the deal.

## CE0001C104 ## 00 ##
Upon returning to Audrey, you reported the mission's success. After thanking you, Audrey promised to fulfill the terms of the deal.

## CE0001C105 ## 00 ##
You have obtained the Anomaly Protector schematics.

## CE0001C106 ## 00 ##
Based on the blueprint you received, you managed to assemble three Anomaly Protectors.

## CE0001C107 ## 00 ##
Arriving at the Fop's Camp, you spoke with Queen Victoria Legrand. She demanded that you participate in a "knightly tournament" taking place in a nearby junkyard.

## CE0001C108 ## 00 ##
After winning the tournament and gaining the Queen's favor, you have received an audience in her trailer.

## CE0001C109 ## 00 ##
Victoria told you that the location of the camp of the First Settlers is known by a Fop named Sherlock, who can be found in the Maze of Death.

## CE0001C10A ## 00 ##
You have managed to find Sherlock, the Fop who knows about the location of the First Settlers' camp.

## CE0001C10B ## 00 ##
Sherlock told you how to get to the camp of the First Settlers.

## CE0001C10C ## 00 ##
From Sherlock's notes, you learned how to get to the camp of the First Settlers.

## CE0001C10D ## 00 ##
A special implant that will protect you from Maelstrom's destructive radiation can only be found in the Temple, where the adherents of the Church of Maelstrom have taken residence.

## CE0001C10E ## 00 ##
You did a favor to Reverend Santiago by preaching three sermons in different parts of the City.

## CE0001C10F ## 00 ##
At the request of the Reverend, you went to the underground chapel of the Maelstrom Church and retrieved the Ejector.

## CE0001C110 ## 00 ##
The implant that protects against Maelstrom's influence is in your hands.

## CE0001C111 ## 00 ##
Having climbed onto the rooftop of Nashville Observation Deck, you have installed a Maelstrom beacon.

## CE0001C112 ## 00 ##
You have installed a Maelstrom beacon in Magellan's parking lot.

## CE0001C113 ## 00 ##
The First Settlers' camp is the closest point to Maelstrom suitable for deploying a Maelstrom beacon, so you put it up right in the center of the camp.

## CE0001C114 ## 00 ##
Sending a research team to the ruins of the Concord would be very expensive. Such expenses can be covered only by the New Committee.

## CE0001C115 ## 00 ##
At Nakamura's request, you destroyed the seized selectrones and provided a disposal certificate.

## CE0001C116 ## 00 ##
Although Nakamura asked you to destroy the seized selectrones, you sold them to Lindbergh and provided a fake disposal certificate.

## CE0001C117 ## 00 ##
Kimiko also asked you to choose a Head of Surveillance in Magellan, and you have done everything so that Indra Kapoor was appointed to this post.

## CE0001C118 ## 00 ##
Kimiko also asked you to choose a Head of Surveillance in Magellan, and you have done everything so that Courtney Reznor was appointed to this post.

## CE0001C119 ## 00 ##
You managed to get funding to send an expedition of scientists to the ruins of Concord.

## CE0001C11A ## 00 ##
They say the Phalanx has everything. Even large trucks, which the Emulator scientists will need to be able to deliver the equipment to the ruins of Concord.

## CE0001C11B ## 00 ##
Hieronymus Zemeckis asked you to interview the residents of Carmine Heights, to find out what they think about his candidacy in the upcoming elections in the settlement.

## CE0001C11C ## 00 ##
You gave Hieronymus honest and objective data.

## CE0001C11D ## 00 ##
You have fulfilled Hieronymus's request carelessly, and gave him inaccurate survey results.

## CE0001C11E ## 00 ##
You falsified results of the survey and gave them to Hieronymus.

## CE0001C11F ## 00 ##
You told Hieronymus that the residents of Carmine Heights are dead.

## CE0001C120 ## 00 ##
Zemeckis told you that he really needs the New Committee employee database and asked you to obtain it.

## CE0001C121 ## 00 ##
You brought Hieronymus the real database of the New Committee employees.

## CE0001C122 ## 00 ##
You brought Hieronymus a fake database of the New Committee employees.

## CE0001C123 ## 00 ##
You brought Hieronymus a corrupted database of the New Committee employees.

## CE0001C124 ## 00 ##
Zemeckis has fulfilled his promise, and now you've got the trucks.

## CE0001C125 ## 00 ##
You have made a deal with the caravan company. They are ready to provide trucks for the expedition.

## CE0001C126 ## 00 ##
Your efforts have borne fruit: thanks to the Maelstrom beacons, the connection with Maelstrom was restored, however, all you managed to do was reducing its radiation to a minimum. In any case, that should be enough to get close to Maelstrom and put an end to it once and for all.

## CE0001C127 ## 00 ##
Upon reaching Concord station, you found that the expedition had already arrived. It was composed not only of scientists, but also those who helped you in any way with the implementation of your plan... It is quite obvious why they are here – they need something from you.

## CE0001C128 ## 00 ##
Not willing to serve anyone's interests, you went straight to the ruins of the station.

## CE0001C129 ## 00 ##
You have visited the New Committee Camp. Nakamura has given you a special helmet that you need to tune in a special way and give back upon returning. This will allow the New Committee to take a leading position under the Dome and subjugate all the survivors under its power.

## CE0001C12A ## 00 ##
Hieronymus Zemeckis, who arrived in the camp near Concord, asked a favor of you: you have to throw into Maelstrom a special device that will transfer the data from it to a special communication center established by Phalanx. Zemeckis is confident that his plan will give the world the best future possible, and at the same time make Phalanx the heart of civilization under the Dome.

## CE0001C12B ## 00 ##
During your travels you came across Carmine Heights – an independent community of engineers and scientists led by a married couple, Johan and Olivia Raysner.

## CE0001C12C ## 00 ##
Johan Raysner believes that Maelstrom can be the key to escaping the Dome. He asked you to turn it into a kind of tunnel through which people will be able to get out with the help of isosuits.

## CE0001C12D ## 00 ##
Olivia Raysner is confident that since people are stuck under the Dome, it is necessary to live the present, not the future. She asked you to turn Maelstrom into a source of creative force able to transform the Dome into a habitable place.

## CE0001C12E ## 00 ##
Before heading to Concord, you visited Russo's camp. Henrietta has shared her doubts: seems that destroying Maelstrom would prove unreasonable. According to her, it will be enough to make the megaloanomaly safe and give it to the hands of scientists.

## CE0001C12F ## 00 ##
Having met Audrey Melville, you've learned her view of the situation with Maelstrom. She advised you to weaken the strength of the anomaly, but also to extend its influence throughout the entire Dome. She believes that this plan will stop the expansion of the Phalanx and the New Committee, and enable mankind to live free in the neutral zones, which would appear across the Barrens...

## CE0001C130 ## 00 ##
Abbot, whom you met in the camp, is still obsessed with the idea to bring as many people as possible to the Church. He advised you to reconfigure Maelstrom so that it became a giant computational system for the virtual world created by the Church.

## CE0001C131 ## 00 ##
Victoria Legrand met you on the outskirts of the camp. She demanded that you deliver her severed head to Maelstrom and decapitated herself...

## CE0001C132 ## 00 ##
Victoria Legrand met you on the outskirts of the camp. She tried to force you to take her severed head to Maelstrom, but you have managed to convince the Queen of the Fops otherwise. Victoria decided to leave her mad subjects behind and go in search of her past.

## CE0001C133 ## 00 ##
You managed to get through the ruins of the station and reach the landing pad.

## CE0001C134 ## 00 ##
Maelstrom seemed within arms reach, but the passage to it was blocked by a dangerous anomaly. After studying it, you realized that it demanded a human sacrifice...

## CE0001C135 ## 00 ##
This sacrifice turned out to be Crump. The Orange entered the anomaly to meet his death.

## CE0001C136 ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Yoko. The robogirl entered the anomaly and burned down to ashes.

## CE0001C137 ## 00 ##
This turned out to be Sparrow. The crime fighter entered the anomaly and thus made the ultimate sacrifice.

## CE0001C138 ## 00 ##
This sacrifice turned out to be Fox. The woman from the Barrens entered the anomaly and perished.

## CE0001C139 ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Katarzyna. However, she refused to sacrifice herself and tried to escape, but eventually fell into the anomaly and perished.

## CE0001C13A ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was to be Jack Ray Branson nicknamed Cheerful Jack. He entered the anomaly and took his final curtain call.

## CE0001C13B ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Kimiko Nakamura. You somehow managed to get her out of the white mist and the Chairwoman of the New Committee met her end.

## CE0001C13C ## 00 ##
This sacrifice turned out to be Abbot. You somehow managed to get him out of the white mist and the head of the Church departed to a better world.

## CE0001C13D ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Olivia Raysner. You somehow managed to get her out of the white mist and the head of Carmine Heights perished.

## CE0001C13E ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was to be Johan Raysner. You somehow managed to get him out of the white mist and the head of Carmine Heights perished.

## CE0001C13F ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Audrey Melville. You somehow managed to get her out of the white mist and the head of the Picnic met her end.

## CE0001C140 ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Hieronymus Zemeckis. You somehow managed to get him out of the white mist and the Phalanx leader was now history.

## CE0001C141 ## 00 ##
This sacrifice was Victoria Legrand. You somehow managed to get her out of the white mist and the mad Fop Queen was no more.

## CE0001C142 ## 00 ##
You climbed on board the transport capsule and went on to meet Maelstrom...

## CE0001C143 ## 00 ##
The road led you to the Phalanx base – a huge fortress towering on a rock. It is home to former prisoners and soldiers, entrepreneurs, mercenaries and adventurers. A man named Hieronymus Zemeckis, nicknamed "Papa", is in charge of this place.

## CE0001C144 ## 00 ##
While traveling, you stumbled upon a filthy junkyard inhabited by desert bandits named Fops. They are led by Queen Victoria Legrand, who is just as mad as her subjects.

## CE0001C145 ## 00 ##
In Junktown slums you occasionally came across some people in scarlet robes, and on the outskirts of the city a huge cathedral was discovered – the heart of Maelstrom Church, a sect, followers of which live in the virtual world. At the head of this religion is a certain Abbot and his right-hand man, Reverend Santiago.

## CE0001C146 ## 00 ##
Both the Magellan base and the City are under control of New Committee – the remnants of CRONUS Corporation, turned totalitarian dictatorship. The quasi-state is led by Kimiko Nakamura.

## CE0001C147 ## 00 ##
The Roadside Picnic staging post has changed a lot since your last visit. Now it is a neutral zone named Picnic. It is managed by Audrey Melville, the gas station caretaker's granddaughter.

## CE0001C148 ## 00 ##
A robogirl named Yoko from Magellan base joined you. She seems to be keen on exploring the world.

## CE0001C149 ## 00 ##
From now on you are accompanied by Crump, a connoisseur of good fights, and a member of the Orange Wing.

## CE0001C14A ## 00 ##
You have met Fox in the arena, a half-crazed woman from the Barrens, and now she has become your companion.

## CE0001C14B ## 00 ##
You have gained a companion who calls himself Sparrow. Fighting the bandits is his main goal in life.

## CE0001C14C ## 00 ##
You are now accompanied in travels by Jack Ray Branson, an actor known under the pseudonym Cheerful Jack.

## CE0001C14D ## 00 ##
Yoko, the robogirl who was exploring the world under the Dome with you, is dead.

## CE0001C14E ## 00 ##
Crump, the Orange Winger that traveled with you, is dead.

## CE0001C14F ## 00 ##
Fox, the girl from the Barrens who traveled with you, is dead.

## CE0001C150 ## 00 ##
Sparrow, the crime fighter who accompanied you in travels, is dead.

## CE0001C151 ## 00 ##
The actor Jack Ray Branson who accompanied you in travels under the Dome, is dead.

## CE0001C16D ## 01 ##
Using your technical knowledge, you have set up the distiller for automatic water distribution.

## CE0001C16E ## 00 ##
You have decided to imbue the severed head of Victoria Legrand with the power of Maelstrom.

## CE0001C16F ## 00 ##
Using the Church's Ejector, you have transferred your consciousness into Maelstrom.

## CE0001C170 ## 00 ##
You have decided to modify Maelstrom so Russo and other scientists could study it as safely as possible.

## CE0001C171 ## 00 ##
After listening to Audrey Melville's arguments, you have weakened Maelstrom, but spread it over the entirety of the Dome.

## CE0001C172 ## 00 ##
You have decided to sabotage Nakamura's triumph by mistuning her helmet that was intended to control Maelstrom.

## CE0001C173 ## 00 ##
You tuned Nakamura's Beta helmet to Maelstrom frequency, thus granting her total control over it.

## CE0001C174 ## 00 ##
Having listened to Olivia, you have decided to turn the Dome into a blooming garden and solve the problem of infertility.

## CE0001C175 ## 00 ##
You have decided that Johan was right and disabled the "Field of Death", thus turning Maelstrom into a tunnel leading outside.

## CE0001C176 ## 00 ##
To jeopardize Zemeckis' plans, you reconfigured his device so that information from Maelstrom is available to all.

## CE0001C177 ## 00 ##
You put Zemeckis' device inside Maelstrom, thereby granting Phalanx an exclusive access to its data.

## CE0001C178 ## 00 ##
You have decided to set up Maelstrom's program so as to lock all the Church followers inside their virtual world.

## CE0001C179 ## 00 ##
You have fulfilled the goal of the Abbot and his Church, and now Maelstrom has become a powerful new computing environment for their virtual world.

## CE0001C17A ## 00 ##
You simply chose to destroy all sentient life under the Dome.

## CE0001C17B ## 00 ##
You simply chose to disable Maelstrom.

## CE0001C17C ## 00 ##
You killed Akira Okawara, Yoko's creator and adoptive father. She will never forgive you for that.

## CE0001C17D ## 00 ##
You gave the Fops the head of their Queen, imbued with the power of Maelstrom. This inspired them so much that they have completely destroyed civilization under the Dome in a couple of weeks.

## CE0001C17E ## 00 ##
Under the rule of Nakamura, the desolated Magellan became a slum populated by unwanted individuals.

## CE0001C17F ## 00 ##
Magellan base was eventually absorbed by the sprawling City, thus losing any remnants of self-government.

## CE0001C180 ## 00 ##
Carmine Heights, residents of which were wiped out by you, was repopulated once again and became the agricultural capital of the Dome.

## CE0001C181 ## 00 ##
Under Nakamura's pressure Carmine Heights has gradually lost its former position, practically turning into a puppet of the Committee.

## CE0001C182 ## 00 ##
The deserted Temple was given out to offices of the Silver Wing.

## CE0001C183 ## 00 ##
Maelstrom Church was officially banned by the authorities, the followers were persecuted, the Temple building confiscated, and religious leaders gone.

## CE0001C184 ## 00 ##
In Nakamura's hands, the technology of virtual reality has become a propaganda tool.

## CE0001C185 ## 00 ##
The destruction of the Picnic had proven the futility of the concept of so-called "neutral zones", and soon they all came to naught.

## CE0001C186 ## 00 ##
Oddly enough, the Committee showed no interest in bending the Picnic Neutral Zone to its will. Over time, the settlement has even grown into a sizeable agglomeration, preserving its neutral status.

## CE0001C187 ## 00 ##
Bled white by you, the Fops were soon completely wiped out by the forces of the New Committee.

## CE0001C188 ## 00 ##
The Fops defied the New Committee for a while, but the persistent long-term policy of total destruction eventually led to their extinction.

## CE0001C189 ## 00 ##
The deserted Phalanx Fortress was eventually occupied by New Committee, without much effort. The Committee then had the opportunity to explore the southern lands of the Dome. Years later, it was already fully explored.

## CE0001C18A ## 00 ##
Despite the outstanding success of New Committee in general, as well as its leader Nakamura in particular, the organization fell into economic and political stagnation in the end, as is often the case with dictatorships.

## CE0001C18B ## 00 ##
Waging spy wars with Phalanx eventually led Nakamura to become paranoid, and she was assassinated in her personal bunker many years later. The Committee plunged into a bloody civil war, which resulted in the ruins of the organization being led by a military junta. Soon the remains of the Committee were absorbed by Phalanx without any effort.

## CE0001C18C ## 00 ##
Universal access to information made any secret plans impossible, prompting the factions to negotiate and cooperate. As a result, many years later, a Union was formed, a new state structure, the citizens of which enjoyed equal rights and relative freedom. However, open dissent was persecuted, and pluralism of opinion was not welcomed, which eventually drove the Union to what seemed to be an eternal era of stagnation.

## CE0001C18D ## 00 ##
Maelstrom has expanded to the entire Dome and sucked all the people into Abbot's virtual reality, inside which some, including yourself, have gained incredible power, while others were less fortunate. In the real world, however, the civilization under the Dome came to an end.

## CE0001C18E ## 00 ##
Once you have destroyed all the people under the Dome, some previously unknown megalithic structures stood out from under the sand, but there was no one left to study them. You've spent your final days as the last person under the Dome.

## CE0001C18F ## 00 ##
After Zemeckis' death, the transmitter continued broadcasting, allowing the Phalanx caravans to become a monopoly and eventually get their hands on all the real power in the City, undermining the position of the New Committee.

## CE0001C190 ## 00 ##
The New Committee was not able to oppose Zemeckis' increased influence. The fate of the Dome now depended solely on his will.

## CE0001C191 ## 00 ##
Despite Zemeckis' growing influence, the New Committee was still well able to oppose him. An era of the cold war between two powerful factions began.

## CE0001C192 ## 00 ##
The deserted City eventually was repopulated, but this new settlement had nothing to do with the New Committee, which came to a final and irreversible end.

## CE0001C193 ## 01 ##
The deserted City was eventually repopulated, and the surviving Nakamura rallied people around her yet again, turning the remnants of the Committee into a closed military organization, and a very hefty price was put on your head.

## CE0001C194 ## 00 ##
The death of the authoritarian Nakamura put New Committee on the to the path of cautious democratization, which had a good impact on its economic prospects.

## CE0001C195 ## 00 ##
Thanks to you, Nakamura's personal power was weakened, and the New Committee embarked on a cautious democratization policy, which had a good impact on its economic prospects.

## CE0001C196 ## 00 ##
Your actions did not particularly affect the fate of the New Committee.

## CE0001C197 ## 00 ##
Thanks to your actions, the New Committee gained unprecedented power.

## CE0001C198 ## 00 ##
Even though you weren't able to fix the water supply problems in Carmine Heights, the residents are still grateful to you for trying.

## CE0001C199 ## 00 ##
Residents of Carmine Heights are grateful for your solution to the water supply problems in the settlement.

The Queen and her subjects are delighted that you not only won in the arena, but also dedicated your victory to Victoria.

## CE0001C1A2 ## 00 ##
The Queen is pleased that you have won in the arena.

## CE0001C1A3 ## 00 ##
Rumors that it was you who spoiled Hiernonymus Zemeckis's election posters reached the Phalanx mercenaries.

## CE0001C1A4 ## 00 ##
The Phalangists are grateful to you for securing the New Committee employee database for Hieronymus.

## CE0001C1A5 ## 00 ##
The Phalangists suspect that you sabotaged Zemeckis's plans by tricking him with the New Committee employee database.

## CE0001C1A6 ## 00 ##
The Phalangists greatly appreciate your help in polling Carmine Heights residents about Zemeckis's candidacy.

## CE0001C1A7 ## 00 ##
Phalanx appreciates your unsuccessful attempt to poll the residents of Carmine Heights about Zemeckis's candidacy.

## CE0001C1A8 ## 00 ##

Hi.[n][n]A friend of mine wrote that the way to Concord is open. We are almost there, only the last step remains, and you are the one to take it.[n][n]My research team is awaiting you at the Concord ruins camp. Hurry up.[n][n]Henry R.

Dear Employee,[n][n]I was surprised to learn that my previous employer, Madame Henrietta Russo, is dead. I don’t know the details (and I don’t think this is my business), but since the treaty is still in force, I will inform you of the latest data regarding Maelstrom radiation.[n][n]Most importantly, the activity of Maelstrom in the vicinity of Concord station ruins dropped to 10%. Within the walls of the station, it reaches 13% -17% and gradually increases upon approaching the landing site. I suppose in your case this means that the vicinity of the station is quite safe to explore.[n][n]I am sorry that Madame Russo passed away, and I offer my condolences. Out of respect for the deceased, I will not charge you money for my information.

“Sometimes I remember the vehicle that I saw in the Rogers parking lot back in 1975: a whopper, made up of several cars, the thing occupied almost the entire parking lot. Through the open doors of one of the cars I saw some kind of barracks, the other was occupied by neatly arranged machinery and workbenches. They say it's gone... I can't imagine where and how you could lose such a giant!"[n][n]Ludwig Schwarzmeier, engineer

Having become an honestly elected mayor, you managed to get Mortensen and Spengler to reconcile, and together you brought the settlement to prosperity.

## CE0001C1C0 ## 00 ##
Upon transferring your consciousness into Maelstrom, you were no longer able to occupy the post of mayor. Mortensen and Spengler continued to struggle for power, as life in Junktown went on.

## CE0001C1C1 ## 00 ##
Upon transferring your consciousness into Maelstrom, you were no longer able to occupy the post of mayor. After being declared the winner, Spengler continued the fight against crime, but his inept economic policy eventually led to the downfall of Junktown.

Upon transferring your consciousness into Maelstrom, you were no longer able to occupy the post of mayor. Mortensen was declared the winner, which led to an economic boom in Junktown. However, Kurt's dismissal from the post of sheriff gradually turned the settlement into a criminal den, which eventually led to it being cleared out by the forces of the New Committee and forcibly annexed by the City.

## CE0001C1C3 ## 00 ##
Upon transferring your consciousness into Maelstrom, you were no longer able to occupy the post of mayor, and there were no other candidates left. Mortensen and Spengler left the settlement. Junktown was impoverished and became a criminal den, which eventually led to it being cleared out by the forces of the New Committee and forcibly annexed by the City.

## CE0001C1C4 ## 00 ##
Having become mayor, you enlisted Mortensen's support and embarked on a policy of Junktown's economic development, but in the absence of a competent sheriff the growing crime rate did not allow Junktown to become a thriving settlement.

## CE0001C1C5 ## 00 ##
Having become mayor, you enlisted Spengler's support and continued to hold crime in check, but the lack of economic incentives did not allow Junktown to become a thriving settlement.

## CE0001C1C6 ## 00 ##
You became mayor of Junktown, but without Mortensen's business acumen and Spengler's strong hand the settlement soon fell into disrepair.

## CE0001C1C7 ## 00 ##
Spengler's death led to a new wave of crime and the rapid decline of Junktown. Soon it was absorbed by the City.

## CE0001C1C8 ## 00 ##
Mortensen's death led to an economic decline of Junktown.

## CE0001C1C9 ## 00 ##
Both Spengler and Mortensen's deaths led to Junktown being transformed into a den teeming with bandits. Soon it was completely deserted.

## CE0001C1CA ## 00 ##
After becoming mayor, Spengler successfully continued the fight against crime. Mortensen's economic activities did not lead to Junktown's prosperity, neither to it turning into a slum. Soon the settlement became part of the City.

## CE0001C1CB ## 00 ##
After becoming mayor, Spengler continued fighting against crime, but his inept economic policy eventually led to Junktown's downfall.

## CE0001C1CC ## 00 ##

Magellan's new administrator decided to strengthen the relationship with the City, and many citizens of the Committee moved to reside at the station.

## CE0001C1CF ## 00 ##
Magellan's new administrator decided to take advantage of the undermined position of the New Committee and declared its independence. The station began to engage in its own scientific research and export electricity.

## CE0001C1D0 ## 00 ##
You did some damage to Magellan, but thanks to Kingsley's competent leadership, the station soon managed to recover and continued to live its own life.

## CE0001C1D1 ## 00 ##
The weakening of the New Committee affected Magellan: The station continued to exist, but it would never be as prosperous as before.

## CE0001C1D2 ## 00 ##
Magellan station continued living its own life.

## CE0001C1D3 ## 00 ##
Surveillance, denunciations and censorship eventually brought the residents of Magellan to an open uprising, which was brutally suppressed.

## CE0001C1D4 ## 00 ##
The bloody events during the elections in Carmine Heights led to a general gathering of residents and the establishment of a new government. Johan's death had a negative impact on the scientific potential of the settlement.

Phalanx could not recover from the blow inflicted by you. The group ceased to exist, and its fortress was abandoned.

## CE0001C211 ## 00 ##
Zemeckis' goal was achieved, but without his leadership the Phalanx could not reasonably use its own advantage, gradually losing its former position.

## CE0001C212 ## 00 ##
Under the wise leadership of Zemeckis, the Phalanx' influence reached unprecedented heights.

Without Zemeckis, the Phalanx' influence gradually began to fade.

## CE0001C214 ## 00 ##

With the death of Zemeckis, hopes to revive civilization were also lost. His analytical center did not live up to expectations in the end, and humanity was never able to overcome infertility.

## CE0001C241 ## 00 ##
Having at its disposal the best minds of the Dome, the Phalanx finally reached the scientific and technological singularity. Infertility, old age and death have been defeated, the Dome's secrets revealed, and the Earth inhabited by a new breed of man, created on the patterns Zemeckis.

## CE0001C242 ## 00 ##
None of the factions succeded at subduing Maelstrom itself, and a delicate balance was established under the Dome.

## CE0001C243 ## 00 ##
Becoming the main force under the Dome, Carmine Heights was able to successfully complete work on the isosuit and make the first expedition outside the Dome. However, its members soon stopped responding. It became clear for the residents of the Dome that more challenges were ahead.

Although Olivia's plan to turn the Dome into the Garden of Eden sounded appealing, it soon became clear that population growth meant a threat of famine, and the hole in the Dome was closing down slowly, threatening to deprive people of a hope ever to get out.

While wanting freedom and independence for all, Audrey never considered that solving the current major problems required centralization, planning, control and hierarchy. Her world turned out poor, hopeless and helpless against serious challenges.

## CE0001C248 ## 00 ##
Once in the hands of scientists, the Dome gradually revealed its secrets. Soon many of the problems, including infertility, have been resolved, and the rest, such as escaping the Dome, were about to be solved. Scientists finally gave a tired humanity hope for the future, and unwittingly received a huge credibility in return.

## CE0001C255 ## 01 ##
A soft seat, a steering wheel and an on-board computer are all you need to comfortably steer a huge road train.

## CE0001C256 ## 02 ##
Kareem al Waleed, a Phalanx soldier whom you met by chance in the City, has told you about Ursula – an enormous road train lost in quicksand, and gave you the coordinates.

## CE0001C257 ## 01 ##
You have found a note that contains the coordinates of a road train stuck in the quicksand. Might be worth checking out...

## CE0001C258 ## 01 ##
While exploring the Barrens, you found a huge road train stuck in quicksand.

## CE0001C259 ## 01 ##
The car has been staying there for a long time, it is covered with sand and dust, but still looks functional.

## CE0001C25A ## 01 ##
You have found the driver's workspace in the cabin of the road train.

## CE0001C25B ## 01 ##
Ursula's core is an old navi computer. Unfortunately, it is currently blocked. You need a keycard that is probably nearby...

## CE0001C25C ## 01 ##
It appears that a member of Ursula's crew has become a necroid. Having searched the pockets miraculously preserved on his uniform, you found a keycard.

## CE0001C25D ## 01 ##
You inserted the keycard and managed to unlock Ursula's on-board computer.

## CE0001C25E ## 01 ##
You failed to start the engine: the car hasn't had any fuel in it for a long time, and you need to find a can of gasoline.

## CE0001C25F ## 01 ##
You have added fuel to Ursula's tank.

## CE0001C260 ## 01 ##
Your attempt to get in motion was unsuccessful: Ursula is firmly stuck in the sands. Perhaps things will work out if you unhitch the cars.

## CE0001C261 ## 02 ##
Having searched the road train, you found the control panel for the wagon hitching mechanism.

## CE0001C262 ## 01 ##
You have disconnected the wagons from the locomotive.

## CE0001C263 ## 01 ##
Ursula has broken free from its sandy captivity![n][n]From now on, you will travel along the roads of the Dome together until death do you part.

Record author: Ben McGuire[n]To: Steel Grip Contest Organizing Committee[n]Record code: F-WBAH-0991[n]Date: May 16, 1976[n][n]All this corporate propaganda and travel diaries is such trash. My father came back from Sicily with a mortar cluster in his chest, and I get to sweat for 40 minutes in this armor so that this stupid broad Rachel can make a good shot.[n][n]There are some nice things about it though: the little parade on Magellan at the start of our mission was very inspiring. Feels good to be in the spotlight. But there also was a little embarrassment there at the end – when the six of us climbed into the elevator, it didn't go anywhere due to overload – and all this was caught on cameras. Rachel screamed so hard her ears popped. By the way, she doesn't like that I call our mission a mission. Says we should call it a "promotional tour". Promotional tour my ass![n][n]The armor's pretty good, by the way, those Horizon engineers sure know what they're doing. It's just that, the battery on the back heats up oddly. I'll have burns if it goes on like this.

They MELTED. What an outrageous way to die, followed by an equally outrageous commemoration. Never, EVER, will I be drinking in this heat again![n][n]Rachel complains about everything – the sun, the heavy camera, the tapes, the sand in socks, and when she doesn't complain, she's just gushing with BIG ideas. Today I came up with the idea of ​​filming the six of us pushing a giant boulder. Yeah sure, we have the armor and all, but she should try doing it herself![n][n]Today I saw the next stage's route: a ten-kilometer run over rough terrain. Think I'll come in first, if only I do a LITTLE cheating and make a shortcut – there, in the gorge, there's just the right bottleneck for this. If I use jump boosters, I will win 30-40 minutes.

Jean wasn't all that bad either, but he shouldn't have cheated.[n]3. Kato is downright strange: all he ever talks about is victory and honor. A worthy aspiration, but with him it's more like a pathological fixation. Carries a large knife with him. Or is it a sword, I don't know. Looks like a small katana.[n]4. The armor's behaving strangely: it turned off the oxygen supply twice due to a false triggering of the fire-extinguishing system.[n]5. Rachel should be court-martialed for her stupid contests.

I feel sorry for this woman.[n][n]While she was sleeping, I grabbed the camera and took some full shots. Maybe some of this will make it into a movie about our campaign (or "promotional tour"? I don't remember what Heidinger called it exactly).[n][n]Right now I got 32 points, Mikhail has 33, the Japanese man is lagging behind – he has 28.

In the morning I learned that there were less than one hundred and twenty kilometers of the last stage. Comrade Tachibana is completely out of spirits. He told me, Just make it till the end, so that we can fight with honor in the finals. A very purposeful boy. Does gymnastics in the morning, doesn't drink, mutters something on his own lingo.[n][n]If he really wants to win, he'll have to try: I unlocked the armor's overdrive servos, this will give me more strength and speed. Comrade organizer even filmed a scene where I crushed a log that has fallen onto the road with my foot. Says he'll include it in the cut.
